Chapter 6
The Schr√∂dinger Equation
In some cases, the slope of the potential energy may be discontinuous, e.g., V(x) may
have one form in one region of space and another form in an adjacent region. (This is
a useful mathematical approximation to real situations in which V(x) varies rapidly
over a small region of space, such as at the surface boundary of a metal.) The proce-
dure in such cases is to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation separately in each region of
space and then require that the solutions join smoothly at the point of discontinuity.
Since the probability of finding a particle cannot vary discontinuously from point
to point, the wave function 
must be continuous.9 Since the Schr√∂dinger equation
involves the second derivative 
the first derivative 
(which is the slope)
must also be continuous. That is, the graph of 
versus x must be smooth. (In a
special case in which the potential energy becomes infinite, this restriction is relaxed.
Since no particle can have infinite potential energy,
must be zero in regions where
V(x) is infinite. Then, at the boundary of such a region,
may be discontinuous.)
If either 
or 
were not finite or not single valued, the same would be
true of 
and 
As we will shortly see, the predictions of wave mechanics
regarding the results of measurements involve both of those quantities and would thus
not necessarily predict finite or definite values for real physical quantities. Such re-
sults would not be acceptable since measurable quantities, such as angular momentum
and position, are never infinite or multiple valued. A final restriction on the form of
the wave function 
is that in order to obey the normalization condition,
must
approach zero sufficiently fast as 
so that normalization is preserved. For fu-
ture reference, we may summarize the conditions that the wave function 
must
meet in order to be acceptable as follows:
1.
must exist and satisfy the Schr√∂dinger equation.
2.
and 
must be continuous.
3.
and 
must be finite.
4.
and 
must be single valued.
5.
fast enough as 
so that the normalization integral, Equation
6-20, remains bounded.
Note that, given Equation 6-10, the acceptability conditions above ultimately apply
to
Questions
1. Like the classical wave equation, the Schr√∂dinger equation is linear. Why is this
important?
2. There is no factor

function that satisfies the classical wave equation?

EXAMPLE 6-1 A Solution to the Schr√∂dinger Equation Show that for a free particle
of mass m moving in one dimension, the function 
is a
solution to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for any values of the con-
stants A and B.
SOLUTION
A free particle has no net force acting upon it, e.g., V(x)  0, in which case the
kinetic energy equals the total energy. Thus,
Differentiating
gives
and differentiating again,
Substituting into Equation 6-18,
and, since 
we have
and the given 
is a solution of Equation 6-18.
6-2 The InfiniteSquare Well
A problem that provides several illustrations of the properties of wave functions and is
also one of the easiest problems to solve using the time-independent, one-dimensional
Schr√∂dinger equation is that of the infinite square well, sometimes called the particle
in a box. A macroscopic example is a bead moving on a frictionless wire between
two massive stops clamped to the wire. We could also build such a ‚Äúbox‚Äù for an elec-
tron using electrodes and grids in an evacuated tube, as illustrated in Figure 6-1a.
The walls of the box are provided by the increasing potential between the grids G
and the electrode C as shown in Figures 6-1b and c. The walls can be made arbitrarily
high and steep by increasing the potential V and reducing the separation between each
grid-electrode pair. In the limit such a potential energy function looks like that in
Figure 6-2, which is a graph of the potential energy of an infinite square well. For this
problem the potential energy is of the form
6-21
Although such a potential is clearly artificial, the problem is worth careful study for
several reasons: (1) exact solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation can be obtained

6-1 The Schr√∂dinger Equation in One Dimension
227
Let us solve Equation 6-15 first. The reason for doing so is twofold: (1) Equation 
6-15 does not contain the potential V(x); consequently, the time-dependent part 
of all solutions 
to the Schr√∂dinger equation will have the same form when
the potential is not an explicit function of time, so we only have to do this once.
(2) The separation constant C has particular significance that we want to discover
before we tackle Equation 6-14. Writing Equation 6-15 as
6-16
The general solution of Equation 6-16 is
6-17a
which can also be written as
6-17b
Thus, we see that 
which describes the time variation of 
is an oscillatory
function with frequency 
However, according to the de Broglie relation
(Equation 5-1), the frequency of the wave represented by 
is 
there-
fore, we conclude that the separation constant C  E, the total energy of the particle,
and we have
6-17c
for all solutions to Equation 6-6 involving time-independent potentials. Equation 6-14
then becomes, on multiplication by 
6-18
Equation 6-18 is referred to as the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation.
The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in one dimension is an ordinary dif-
ferential equation in one variable x and is therefore much easier to handle than the
general form of Equation 6-6. The normalization condition of Equation 6-9 can be ex-
pressed in terms of 
since the time dependence of the absolute square of the wave
function cancels. We have
6-19
and Equation 6-9 then becomes
6-20
Conditions for AcceptableWave Functions
The form of the wave function 
that satisfies Equation 6-18 depends on the form
of the potential energy function V(x). In the next few sections we will study some sim-
ple but important problems in which V(x) is specified. Our example potentials will be
approximations to real physical potentials, simplified to make calculations easier.

Relativity I
A paradox seems to arise when this situation is viewed in the rest system of the run-
ner. For him the pole, being at rest in the same inertial system, has its proper length
of 10 m. However, the runner measures the length of the barn to be
How can he possibly fit the 10-m pole into the length-contracted 2.5-m barn? The
answer is that he can‚Äôt, and the paradox vanishes, but how can that be? To understand
the answer, we need to examine two events‚Äîthe coincidences of both the front and
back ends of the pole, respectively, with the rear and front doors of the barn‚Äîin the
inertial frame of the farmer and in that of the runner.
These are illustrated by the spacetime diagrams of the inertial frame S of the
farmer and barn (Figure 1-37b) and that of the runner S (Figure 1-37c). Both dia-
grams are drawn with the front end of the pole coinciding with the front door of the
barn at the instant the clocks are started. In Figure 1-37b the worldlines of the barn
doors are, of course, vertical, while those of the two ends of the pole make an angle 
 tan1
 49.1¬∞ with the x axis. Note that in S the front of the pole reaches
the rear door of the barn at ct  5 m 0.866  5.8 m simultaneous with the arrival of
the back end of the pole at the front door; i.e., at that instant in S the pole is entirely
contained in the barn.
In the runner‚Äôs rest system S it is the worldlines of the ends of the pole that are
vertical, while those of the front and rear doors of the barn make angles of 49.1¬∞ with
the x axis (since the barn moves in the x direction at v). Now we see that the rear
door passes the front of the pole at ct  2.5 m 0.866  2.9 m, but the front door of
the barn doesn‚Äôt reach the rear of the pole until ct  10 m 0.866  11.5 m. Thus, the
first of those two events occurs before the second, and the runner never sees the pole
entirely contained in the barn. Once again, the relativity of simultaneity is the key‚Äî
events simultaneous in one inertial frame are not necessarily simultaneous when
viewed from another inertial frame.
Now let‚Äôs consider a different version of this paradox, the one initially due to 
W. Rindler. Suppose the barn‚Äôs back wall were made of thick, armor-plate steel and
had no door. What do the farmer and the runner see then? Once again, in the farmer‚Äôs
(and the barn‚Äôs) rest frame, the instant the front of the pole reaches the armor plate, the
farmer shuts the door and the 10-m pole is instantaneously contained in the 5-m barn.
However, in the next instant (assuming that the pole doesn‚Äôt break) it must either bend
(i.e., rotate in spacetime) or break through the armor plate. Since this is relativity, the
runner must come to the same conclusion in his rest frame as the 2.5-m barn races to-
ward him at 
But now when the armor plate back wall contacts the front of
the pole, the barn continues to move at 
taking the front of the pole with it
and leaving at that instant 7.5 m of the pole still outside the barn. Yet like the farmer,
the runner must also see the 10-m pole entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn. How
can that be? Like this: the instant the tip of the pole hits the steel plate, that information
(an elastic shock wave) begins to propagate down the pole. Even if the wave were to
propagate at the speed of light c, it will take 
to reach the back of the pole. In the meantime, the barn door must move only 7.5 m to
reach the back of the pole and does so in only 
Thus, the runner, in agreement with the farmer, sees the 10-m pole
entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn‚Äîat least briefly!

chapter 6
the schr√∂dinger equation
in some cases, the slope of the potential energy may be discontinuous, e.g., v(x) may
have one form in one region of space and another form in an adjacent region. (this is
a useful mathematical approximation to real situations in which v(x) varies rapidly
over a small region of space, such as at the surface boundary of a metal.) the proce-
dure in such cases is to solve the schr√∂dinger equation separately in each region of
space and then require that the solutions join smoothly at the point of discontinuity.
since the probability of finding a particle cannot vary discontinuously from point
to point, the wave function 
must be continuous.9 since the schr√∂dinger equation
involves the second derivative 
the first derivative 
(which is the slope)
must also be continuous. that is, the graph of 
versus x must be smooth. (in a
special case in which the potential energy becomes infinite, this restriction is relaxed.
since no particle can have infinite potential energy,
must be zero in regions where
v(x) is infinite. then, at the boundary of such a region,
may be discontinuous.)
if either 
or 
were not finite or not single valued, the same would be
true of 
and 
as we will shortly see, the predictions of wave mechanics
regarding the results of measurements involve both of those quantities and would thus
not necessarily predict finite or definite values for real physical quantities. such re-
sults would not be acceptable since measurable quantities, such as angular momentum
and position, are never infinite or multiple valued. a final restriction on the form of
the wave function 
is that in order to obey the normalization condition,
must
approach zero sufficiently fast as 
so that normalization is preserved. for fu-
ture reference, we may summarize the conditions that the wave function 
must
meet in order to be acceptable as follows:
1.
must exist and satisfy the schr√∂dinger equation.
2.
and 
must be continuous.
3.
and 
must be finite.
4.
and 
must be single valued.
5.
fast enough as 
so that the normalization integral, equation
6-20, remains bounded.
note that, given equation 6-10, the acceptability conditions above ultimately apply
to
questions
1. like the classical wave equation, the schr√∂dinger equation is linear. why is this
important?
2. there is no factor 
in equation 6-18. does this mean that 
must
be real?
3. why must the electric field 
be real? is it possible to find a nonreal wave
function that satisfies the classical wave equation?
4. describe how the de broglie hypothesis enters into the schr√∂dinger wave
equation.

energy for a particle with mass to the total energy e in the de broglie relation

6-2 the infinitesquare well
a problem that provides several illustrations of the properties of wave functions and is
also one of the easiest problems to solve using the time-independent, one-dimensional
schr√∂dinger equation is that of the infinite square well, sometimes called the particle
in a box. a macroscopic example is a bead moving on a frictionless wire between
two massive stops clamped to the wire. we could also build such a ‚Äúbox‚Äù for an elec-
tron using electrodes and grids in an evacuated tube, as illustrated in figure 6-1a.
the walls of the box are provided by the increasing potential between the grids g
and the electrode c as shown in figures 6-1b and c. the walls can be made arbitrarily
high and steep by increasing the potential v and reducing the separation between each
grid-electrode pair. in the limit such a potential energy function looks like that in
figure 6-2, which is a graph of the potential energy of an infinite square well. for this
problem the potential energy is of the form
6-21
although such a potential is clearly artificial, the problem is worth careful study for
several reasons: (1) exact solutions to the schr√∂dinger equation can be obtained

6-1 the schr√∂dinger equation in one dimension
227
let us solve equation 6-15 first. the reason for doing so is twofold: (1) equation 
6-15 does not contain the potential v(x); consequently, the time-dependent part 
of all solutions 
to the schr√∂dinger equation will have the same form when
the potential is not an explicit function of time, so we only have to do this once.
(2) the separation constant c has particular significance that we want to discover
before we tackle equation 6-14. writing equation 6-15 as
6-16
the general solution of equation 6-16 is
6-17a
which can also be written as
6-17b
thus, we see that 
which describes the time variation of 
is an oscillatory
function with frequency 
however, according to the de broglie relation
(equation 5-1), the frequency of the wave represented by 
is 
there-
fore, we conclude that the separation constant c  e, the total energy of the particle,
and we have
6-17c
for all solutions to equation 6-6 involving time-independent potentials. equation 6-14
then becomes, on multiplication by 
6-18
equation 6-18 is referred to as the time-independent schr√∂dinger equation.
the time-independent schr√∂dinger equation in one dimension is an ordinary dif-
ferential equation in one variable x and is therefore much easier to handle than the
general form of equation 6-6. the normalization condition of equation 6-9 can be ex-
pressed in terms of 
since the time dependence of the absolute square of the wave
function cancels. we have
6-19
and equation 6-9 then becomes
6-20
conditions for acceptablewave functions
the form of the wave function 
that satisfies equation 6-18 depends on the form
of the potential energy function v(x). in the next few sections we will study some sim-
ple but important problems in which v(x) is specified. our example potentials will be
approximations to real physical potentials, simplified to make calculations easier.

larger of each pair of peaks?
4-36. the transition from the first excited state to the ground state in potassium results in the
emission of a photon with

if such a collision is a head-on, what fraction of its initial kinetic energy will an electron lose,

relativity i
a paradox seems to arise when this situation is viewed in the rest system of the run-
ner. for him the pole, being at rest in the same inertial system, has its proper length
of 10 m. however, the runner measures the length of the barn to be
how can he possibly fit the 10-m pole into the length-contracted 2.5-m barn? the
answer is that he can‚Äôt, and the paradox vanishes, but how can that be? to understand
the answer, we need to examine two events‚Äîthe coincidences of both the front and
back ends of the pole, respectively, with the rear and front doors of the barn‚Äîin the
inertial frame of the farmer and in that of the runner.
these are illustrated by the spacetime diagrams of the inertial frame s of the
farmer and barn (figure 1-37b) and that of the runner s (figure 1-37c). both dia-
grams are drawn with the front end of the pole coinciding with the front door of the
barn at the instant the clocks are started. in figure 1-37b the worldlines of the barn
doors are, of course, vertical, while those of the two ends of the pole make an angle 
 tan1
 49.1¬∞ with the x axis. note that in s the front of the pole reaches
the rear door of the barn at ct  5 m 0.866  5.8 m simultaneous with the arrival of
the back end of the pole at the front door; i.e., at that instant in s the pole is entirely
contained in the barn.
in the runner‚Äôs rest system s it is the worldlines of the ends of the pole that are
vertical, while those of the front and rear doors of the barn make angles of 49.1¬∞ with
the x axis (since the barn moves in the x direction at v). now we see that the rear
door passes the front of the pole at ct  2.5 m 0.866  2.9 m, but the front door of
the barn doesn‚Äôt reach the rear of the pole until ct  10 m 0.866  11.5 m. thus, the
first of those two events occurs before the second, and the runner never sees the pole
entirely contained in the barn. once again, the relativity of simultaneity is the key‚Äî
events simultaneous in one inertial frame are not necessarily simultaneous when
viewed from another inertial frame.
now let‚Äôs consider a different version of this paradox, the one initially due to 
w. rindler. suppose the barn‚Äôs back wall were made of thick, armor-plate steel and
had no door. what do the farmer and the runner see then? once again, in the farmer‚Äôs
(and the barn‚Äôs) rest frame, the instant the front of the pole reaches the armor plate, the
farmer shuts the door and the 10-m pole is instantaneously contained in the 5-m barn.
however, in the next instant (assuming that the pole doesn‚Äôt break) it must either bend
(i.e., rotate in spacetime) or break through the armor plate. since this is relativity, the
runner must come to the same conclusion in his rest frame as the 2.5-m barn races to-
ward him at 
but now when the armor plate back wall contacts the front of
the pole, the barn continues to move at 
taking the front of the pole with it
and leaving at that instant 7.5 m of the pole still outside the barn. yet like the farmer,
the runner must also see the 10-m pole entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn. how
can that be? like this: the instant the tip of the pole hits the steel plate, that information
(an elastic shock wave) begins to propagate down the pole. even if the wave were to
propagate at the speed of light c, it will take 
to reach the back of the pole. in the meantime, the barn door must move only 7.5 m to
reach the back of the pole and does so in only 
thus, the runner, in agreement with the farmer, sees the 10-m pole
entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn‚Äîat least briefly!

quantization of charge, light, and energy
arthur compton. after
discovering the compton
effect, he became a world
traveler seeking an
explanation for cosmic rays.
he ultimately showed that
their intensity varied with
latitude, indicating an
interaction with earth‚Äôs
magnetic field, and thus
proved that they are charged
particles. [courtesy of

each scattering angle corresponds to scattering with no shift in the wavelength due
to scattering by the inner electrons of carbon. since these are tightly bound to the
atom, it is the entire atom that recoils rather than the individual electrons. the ex-
pected shift in this case is given by equation 3-25, with 
being the mass of the atom,
which is about 
times that of the electron; thus, this shift is negligible. the varia-
tion of 
with 
was found to be that predicted by equation 3-25.
we have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with matter is a discrete interaction that occurs at the
atomic level. it is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

each scattering angle corresponds to scattering with no shift in the wavelength due
to scattering by the inner electrons of carbon. since these are tightly bound to the
atom, it is the entire atom that recoils rather than the individual electrons. the ex-
pected shift in this case is given by equation 3-25, with 
being the mass of the atom,
which is about 
times that of the electron; thus, this shift is negligible. the varia-
tion of 
with 
was found to be that predicted by equation 3-25.
we have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with matter is a discrete interaction that occurs at the
atomic level. it is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

chapter 4
the nuclear atom
4-5 the franck-hertz experiment
we conclude this chapter with discussion of an important experiment that provi-
ded strong support for the quantization of atomic energies, thus helping to pave the
way for modern quantum mechanics. while investigating the inelastic scattering of
electrons, j. franck and g. hertz20 made a discovery that confirmed by direct
measurement bohr‚Äôs hypothesis of energy quantization in atoms. first done in 1914,
it is now a standard undergraduate laboratory experiment. figure 4-22a is a schematic
diagram of the apparatus. a small heater heats the cathode. electrons are ejected from
the heated cathode and accelerated toward a grid, which is at a positive potential v0
relative to the cathode. some electrons pass through the grid and reach the plate p,
which is at a slightly lower potential vp  v0  v. the tube is filled with a 
low-pressure gas of the element being investigated (mercury vapor, in franck and
hertz‚Äôs experiment). the experiment involves measuring the plate current as a func-
tion of v0. as v0 is increased from 0, the current increases until a critical value (about
4.9 v for hg) is reached, at which point the current suddenly decreases. as v0 is in-
creased further, the current rises again.
the explanation of this result is a bit easier to visualize if we think for the mo-
ment of a tube filled with hydrogen atoms instead of mercury. (see figure 4-22b.)
electrons accelerated by v0 that collide with hydrogen electrons cannot transfer en-
ergy to the latter unless they have acquired kinetic energy ev0  e2  e1  10.2 ev
since the hydrogen electron according to bohr‚Äôs model cannot occupy states with en-
ergies intermediate between e1 and e2. such a collision will thus be elastic; i.e., the
incident electron‚Äôs kinetic energy will be unchanged by the collision, and thus it can
overcome the potential v and contribute to the current i. however, if ev0

figure 4-22 (a) schematic diagram of the franck-hertz experiment. electrons ejected from the heated cathode c at zero
potential are drawn to the positive grid g. those passing through the holes in the grid can reach the plate p and thereby
contribute to the current i if they have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the small back potential v. the tube contains a
low-pressure gas of the element being studied. (b) results for hydrogen. if the incoming electron does not have sufficient
energy to transfer e  e2  e1 to the hydrogen electron in the n  1 orbit (ground state), then the scattering will be elastic.
if the incoming electron does have at least e kinetic energy, then an inelastic collision can occur in which e is transferred to
the n  1 electron, moving it to the n  2 orbit. the excited electron will typically return to the ground state very quickly,
emitting a photon of energy e. 4-5 the franck-hertz experiment
175
then the incoming electron can transfer 10.2 ev to the hydrogen electron in the ground
state (n  1 orbit), putting it into the n  2 orbit (called the first excited state). the
incoming electron‚Äôs energy is thus reduced by 10.2 ev; it has been inelastically scat-
tered. with insufficient energy to overcome the small retarding potential v, the in-
coming electrons can no longer contribute to the plate current i, and i drops sharply.
the situation with hg in the tube is more complicated since hg has 80 electrons.
although bohr‚Äôs theory cannot predict their individual energies, we still expect the en-
ergy to be quantized with a ground state, first excited state, and so on, for the atom.
thus, the explanation of the observed 4.9-v critical potential for hg is that the first
excited state is about 4.9 ev above the lowest level (ground state). electrons with en-
ergy less than this cannot lose energy to the hg atoms, but electrons with energy
greater than 4.9 ev can have inelastic collisions and lose 4.9 ev. if this happens near
the grid, these electrons cannot gain enough energy to overcome the small back volt-
age v and reach the plate; the current therefore decreases. if this explanation is cor-
rect, the hg atoms that are excited to an energy level of 4.9 ev above the ground state
should return to the ground state by emitting light of wavelength
there is indeed a line of this wavelength in the mercury spectrum. when the tube is
viewed with a spectroscope, this line is seen when v0 is greater than 4.9 ev, while no
lines are seen when v0 is less than this amount. for further increases in v0, additional
sharp decreases in the current are observed, corresponding either to excitation of other
levels in hg (e.g., the second excited state of hg is at 6.7 ev above the ground state)
or to multiple excitations of the first excited state, i.e., due to an electron losing 4.9
ev more than once. in the usual setup, multiple excitations of the first level are
observed and dips are seen every 4.9 v.21 the probability of observing such multiple
first-level excitations, or excitations of other levels, depends on the detailed variation
of the potential of the tube. for example, a second decrease in the current at
v0  2  4.9  9.8 v results when electrons have inelastic collisions with hg atoms
about halfway between the cathode and grid (see figure 4-22a). they are reacceler-
ated, reaching 4.9 ev again in the vicinity of the grid. a plot of the data of franck and
hertz is shown in figure 4-23.
the franck-hertz experiment was an important confirmation of the idea that dis-
crete optical spectra were due to the existence in atoms of discrete energy levels that
could be excited by nonoptical methods. it is particularly gratifying to be able to de-
tect the existence of discrete energy levels directly by measurements using only volt-
meters and ammeters.
electron energy loss spectroscopy
the franck-hertz experiment was the precursor of a highly sensitive technique for
measuring the quantized energy states of atoms in both gases and solids. the tech-
nique, called electron energy loss spectroscopy (eels), is particularly useful in
solids, where it makes possible measurement of the energy of certain types of lattice
vibrations and other processes. it works like this. suppose that the electrons in an in-
cident beam all have energy einc. they collide with the atoms of a material, causing
them to undergo some process (e.g., vibration, lattice rearrangement, electron excita-
tion) that requires energy el. then, if a beam electron initiates a single such process,
it will exit the material with energy einc  el ‚Äîi.e., it has been inelastically scattered.

auger electrons
the process of producing x rays necessarily results in the ionization of the atom since
an inner electron is ejected. the vacancy created is filled by an outer electron, pro-
ducing the x rays studied by moseley. in 1923 pierre auger discovered that, as an
alternative to x-ray emission, the atom may eject a third electron from a higher-energy
outer shell via a radiationless process called the auger effect. in the auger (pro-
nounced oh-zhay) process, the energy difference e  e2  e1 that could have
resulted in the emission of a 
x ray is removed from the atom by the third electron,
e.g., one in the n  3 shell. since the magnitude of e3  e, the n  3 electron would
leave the atom with a characteristic kinetic energy 
which is determined by
the stationary-state energies of the particular atom.19 thus, each element has a char-
acteristic auger electron spectrum. (see figure 4-21a.) measurement of the auger
electrons provides a simple and highly sensitive tool for identifying impurities on
clean surfaces in electron microscope systems and investigating electron energy shifts
associated with molecular bonding. (see figure 4-21b.)

he idea that all matter is composed of tiny particles, or atoms, dates to the specu-

450 b.c. however, little attempt was made to correlate such speculations with obser-
vations of the physical world until the seventeenth century. pierre gassendi, in the
mid-seventeenth century, and robert hooke, somewhat later, attempted to explain
states of matter and the transitions between them with a model of tiny, indestructible
solid objects flying in all directions. but it was avogadro‚Äôs hypothesis, advanced in
1811, that all gases at a given temperature contain the same number of molecules per
unit volume, that led to great success in the interpretation of chemical reactions and
to development of kinetic theory in about 1900. avogadro‚Äôs hypothesis made possible
quantitative understanding of many bulk properties of matter and led to general
(though not unanimous) acceptance of the molecular theory of matter. thus, matter is
not continuous, as it appears, but is quantized (i.e., discrete) on the microscopic scale.
scientists of the day understood that the small size of the atom prevented the dis-
creteness of matter from being readily observable.
in this chapter, we will study how three additional great quantization discoveries
were made: (1) electric charge, (2) light energy, and (3) energy of oscillating me-
chanical systems. the quantization of electric charge was not particularly surprising
to scientists in 1900; it was quite analogous to the quantization of mass. however, the
quantization of light energy and mechanical energy, which are of central importance
in modern physics, were revolutionary ideas.
3-1 quantization of electric charge
early measurements of
and 
the first estimates of the order of magnitude of the electric charges found in atoms were
obtained from faraday‚Äôs law. the work of michael faraday (1791‚Äì1867) in the early to
mid-1800s stands out even today for its vision, experimental ingenuity, and thorough-
ness. the story of this self-educated blacksmith‚Äôs son who rose from errand boy and

compton effect
it had been observed that scattered x rays were ‚Äúsofter‚Äù than those in the incident
beam, that is, were absorbed more readily. compton16 pointed out that if the scatter-
ing process were considered a ‚Äúcollision‚Äù between a photon of energy 
(and mo-
mentum 
) and an electron, the recoiling electron would absorb part of the inci-
dent photon‚Äôs energy. the energy 
of the scattered photon would therefore be less
than the incident one and thus of lower frequency 
and momentum 
(the fact
that electromagnetic radiation of energy 
carried momentum 
was known from
classical theory and from the experiments of nichols and hull in 1903. this relation
is also consistent with the relativistic expression 
for a particle
with zero rest energy.) compton applied the laws of conservation of momentum and
energy in their relativistic form (see chapter 2) to the collision of a photon with an
isolated electron to obtain the change in the wavelength 
of the photon as a
function of the scattering angle 
the result, called compton‚Äôs equation and derived
in a more section on the home page, is
3-25
the change in wavelength is thus predicted to be independent of the original wave-
length. the quantity 
has the dimensions of length and is called the compton
wavelength of the electron. its value is
because 
is small, it is difficult to observe unless 
is very small so that the
fractional change 
is appreciable. for this reason the compton effect is
generally only observed for x rays and gamma radiation.
compton verified his result experimentally using the characteristic x-ray line of
wavelength 0.0711 nm from molybdenum for the incident monochromatic photons
and scattering these photons from electrons in graphite. the wavelength of the scat-
tered photons was measured using a bragg crystal spectrometer. his experimental
arrangement is shown in figure 3-16; figure 3-17 shows his results. the first peak at

quantization of charge, light, and energy
arthur compton. after
discovering the compton
effect, he became a world
traveler seeking an
explanation for cosmic rays.
he ultimately showed that
their intensity varied with
latitude, indicating an
interaction with earth‚Äôs
magnetic field, and thus
proved that they are charged
particles. [courtesy of
american institute of physics,
niels bohr library.]
each scattering angle corresponds to scattering with no shift in the wavelength due
to scattering by the inner electrons of carbon. since these are tightly bound to the
atom, it is the entire atom that recoils rather than the individual electrons. the ex-
pected shift in this case is given by equation 3-25, with 
being the mass of the atom,
which is about 
times that of the electron; thus, this shift is negligible. the varia-
tion of 
with 
was found to be that predicted by equation 3-25.
we have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with matter is a discrete interaction that occurs at the
atomic level. it is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

questions
5. why is it extremely difficult to observe the compton effect using visible light?
6. why is the compton effect unimportant in the transmission of television and
radio waves? how many compton scatterings would a typical fm signal have
before its wavelengths were shifted by 0.01 percent?

Relativity I
1-22. A nova is the sudden, brief brightening of a star (see Chapter 13). Suppose Earth as-
tronomers see two novas occur simultaneously, one in the constellation Orion (the Hunter) and
the other in the constellation Lyra (the Lyre). Both nova are the same distance from Earth,
and are in exactly opposite directions from Earth. Observers on board an air-
craft flying at 1000 km h on a line from Orion toward Lyra see the same novas, but note that
they are not simultaneous. (a) For the observers on the aircraft, how much time separates the
nova? (b) Which one occurs first? (Assume Earth is an inertial reference frame.)
1-23. A meter stick moves parallel to its length with speed v  0.6c relative to you.
(a) Compute the length of the stick measured by you. (b) How long does it take for the stick
to pass you? (c) Draw a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of your frame with the front
of the meter stick at x  0 when t  0. Show how the answers to (a) and (b) are obtained from
the diagram.
1-24. The proper mean lifetime of 
mesons (pions) is 2.6  10‚Äì8 s. If a beam of such parti-
cles has speed 0.9c, (a) What would their mean life be as measured in the laboratory? (b) How
far would they travel (on the average) before they decay? (c) What would your answer be to part
(b) if you neglected time dilation? (d) What is the interval in spacetime between creation of a
typical pion and its decay?
1-25. You have been posted to a remote region of space to monitor traffic. Near the end of a
quiet shift, a spacecraft streaks past. Your laser-based measuring device reports the spacecraft‚Äôs
length to be 85 m. The identification transponder reports it to be the NCXXB-12, a cargo craft
of proper length 100 m. In transmitting your report to headquarters, what speed should you give
for this spacecraft?
1-26. The light clock in the spaceship in Figure 1-25 uses a light pulse moving up the y-axis to
reflect back from a mirror as the ship moves along the x-axis. Suppose instead the light pulse
moves along the x-axis between x  0 and a mirror at x  L. (a) What is the time required
for the pulse to make a round trip in the rest system of the spaceship? (b) What is the round-trip
time in the laboratory frame? (c) Does the result in (b) agree with that expected from time di-
lation? Justify your answer.
1-27. Two spaceships pass each other traveling in opposite directions. A passenger on ship A,
which she knows to be 100 m long, notes that ship B is moving with a speed of 0.92c relative
to A and that the length of B is 36 m. What are the lengths of the two spaceships measured by
a passenger in B?
1-28. A meter stick at rest in S is tilted at an angle of 30¬∞ to the x axis. If S moves at 
how long is the meter stick as measured in S and what angle does it make with the x axis?

ented as shown in Figure 1-44. S moves with 
with respect to the laboratory frame S.
(a) Compute the volume of the box in S and in S. (b) Draw an accurate diagram of the box as
seen by an observer in S.
Section 1-5 The Doppler Effect
1-30. How fast must you be moving toward a red light (
nm) for it to appear yellow
(
nm)? green (
nm)? blue (
nm)?
1-31. A distant galaxy is moving away from us at speed 1.85  107 m s. Calculate the frac-
tional red shift 
of the light from this galaxy.
1-32. The light from a nearby star is observed to be shifted toward the blue by 2 percent, i.e.,
Is the star approaching or receding from Earth? How fast is it moving? (Assume
motion is directly toward or away from Earth to avoid superluminal speeds.)
1-33. Stars typically emit the red light of atomic hydrogen with wavelength 656.3 nm (called
the 
spectral line). Compute the wavelength of that light observed at Earth from stars reced-
ing directly from us with relative speed v  103c, v  102c, and v  101c.

We have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction

atomic level. It is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-

a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.

A Final Comment
In this chapter, together with Section 2-4 of the previous chapter, we have introduced
and discussed at some length the three primary ways by which photons interact with
matter: (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) the Compton effect, and (3) pair production.
As we proceed with our explorations of modern physics throughout the remainder of
the book, we will have many occasions to apply what we have learned here to aid in
our understanding of myriad phenomena, ranging from atomic structure to the fusion
‚Äúfurnaces‚Äù of stars.

1. This Gedankenexperiment (thought experiment) is based
on one first suggested by G. N. Lewis and R. C. Tolman,
Philosophical Magazine, 18, 510, (1909).
2. You can see that this is so by rotating Figure 2-1a through
180¬∞ in its own plane; it then matches Figure 2-1b exactly.
3. C. G. Adler, American Journal of Physics, 55, 739 (1987).
4. This idea grew out of the results of the measurements of
masses in chemical reactions in the nineteenth century, which,
within the limits of experimental uncertainties of the time,
were always observed to conserve mass. The conservation of
energy had a similar origin in the experiments of James Joule
(1818‚Äì1889) as interpreted by Hermann von Helmholtz
(1821‚Äì1894). This is not an unusual way for conservation
laws to originate; they still do it this way.
5. The approximation of Equation 2-10 used in this discus-
sion was, of course, not developed from Newton‚Äôs equations.
The rest energy mc2 has no classical counterpart.
6. ‚ÄúFacilitates‚Äù means that we don‚Äôt have to make frequent
unit conversions or carry along large powers of 10 with nearly
every factor in many calculations. However, a word of caution
is in order. Always remember that the eV is not a basic SI unit.
When making calculations whose results are to be in SI units,
don‚Äôt forget to convert the eV!
7. A. Einstein, Annalen der Physik, 17, 1905.
8. Strictly speaking, the time component should be written
ict, where 
The i is the origin of the minus sign in
the spacetime interval, as well as in Equation 2-32 for the
energy/momentum four-vector and other four-vectors in both
special and general relativity. Its inclusion was a contribution of
Hermann Minkowski (1864‚Äì1909), a Russian-German mathe-
matician who developed the geometric interpretation of relativ-
ity and who was one of Einstein‚Äôs professors at Zurich.
Consideration of the four-dimensional geometry is beyond the
scope of our discussions, so we will not be concerned with the i.

Notes
1. This Gedankenexperiment (thought experiment) is based
on one first suggested by G. N. Lewis and R. C. Tolman,
Philosophical Magazine, 18, 510, (1909).
2. You can see that this is so by rotating Figure 2-1a through
180¬∞ in its own plane; it then matches Figure 2-1b exactly.
3. C. G. Adler, American Journal of Physics, 55, 739 (1987).
4. This idea grew out of the results of the measurements of
masses in chemical reactions in the nineteenth century, which,
within the limits of experimental uncertainties of the time,
were always observed to conserve mass. The conservation of
energy had a similar origin in the experiments of James Joule
(1818‚Äì1889) as interpreted by Hermann von Helmholtz
(1821‚Äì1894). This is not an unusual way for conservation
laws to originate; they still do it this way.
5. The approximation of Equation 2-10 used in this discus-
sion was, of course, not developed from Newton‚Äôs equations.
The rest energy mc2 has no classical counterpart.
6. ‚ÄúFacilitates‚Äù means that we don‚Äôt have to make frequent
unit conversions or carry along large powers of 10 with nearly
every factor in many calculations. However, a word of caution
is in order. Always remember that the eV is not a basic SI unit.
When making calculations whose results are to be in SI units,
don‚Äôt forget to convert the eV!
7. A. Einstein, Annalen der Physik, 17, 1905.
8. Strictly speaking, the time component should be written
ict, where 
The i is the origin of the minus sign in
the spacetime interval, as well as in Equation 2-32 for the
energy/momentum four-vector and other four-vectors in both
special and general relativity. Its inclusion was a contribution of
Hermann Minkowski (1864‚Äì1909), a Russian-German mathe-
matician who developed the geometric interpretation of relativ-
ity and who was one of Einstein‚Äôs professors at Zurich.
Consideration of the four-dimensional geometry is beyond the
scope of our discussions, so we will not be concerned with the i.

Compton Effect
It had been observed that scattered x rays were ‚Äúsofter‚Äù than those in the incident
beam, that is, were absorbed more readily. Compton16 pointed out that if the scatter-
ing process were considered a ‚Äúcollision‚Äù between a photon of energy 
(and mo-
mentum 
) and an electron, the recoiling electron would absorb part of the inci-
dent photon‚Äôs energy. The energy 
of the scattered photon would therefore be less
than the incident one and thus of lower frequency 
and momentum 
(The fact
that electromagnetic radiation of energy 
carried momentum 
was known from
classical theory and from the experiments of Nichols and Hull in 1903. This relation
is also consistent with the relativistic expression 
for a particle
with zero rest energy.) Compton applied the laws of conservation of momentum and
energy in their relativistic form (see Chapter 2) to the collision of a photon with an
isolated electron to obtain the change in the wavelength 
of the photon as a
function of the scattering angle 
The result, called Compton‚Äôs equation and derived
in a More section on the home page, is
3-25
The change in wavelength is thus predicted to be independent of the original wave-
length. The quantity 
has the dimensions of length and is called the Compton
wavelength of the electron. Its value is
Because 
is small, it is difficult to observe unless 
is very small so that the
fractional change 
is appreciable. For this reason the Compton effect is
generally only observed for x rays and gamma radiation.
Compton verified his result experimentally using the characteristic x-ray line of
wavelength 0.0711 nm from molybdenum for the incident monochromatic photons
and scattering these photons from electrons in graphite. The wavelength of the scat-
tered photons was measured using a Bragg crystal spectrometer. His experimental
arrangement is shown in Figure 3-16; Figure 3-17 shows his results. The first peak at

A Final Comment
In this chapter, together with Section 2-4 of the previous chapter, we have introduced
and discussed at some length the three primary ways by which photons interact with
matter: (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) the Compton effect, and (3) pair production.
As we proceed with our explorations of modern physics throughout the remainder of
the book, we will have many occasions to apply what we have learned here to aid in
our understanding of myriad phenomena, ranging from atomic structure to the fusion
‚Äúfurnaces‚Äù of stars.

the word science come from a latin word scientia which mean to know . science is the knowledge gained through the systematic observation and experiment . scientific method include the systematic observation reasoning modeling and theoretical prediction . science is divided into two broad category asnatural science andphilosophical science . natural science ha many discipline physic being one of them . the word physic ha it origin in a greek word physis meaning nature . physic is the most basic science which deal with the study of nature and natural phenomenon especially property of matter energy and their interaction . understanding of science begin with understanding of physic . physic is an empirical study . everything we know about physical world and about the principle that govern it behaviour ha been learned through observation of the phenomenon of nature . the ultimate test of any physical theory is it agreement with observation and measurement of physical phenomenon . technology is the application of the doctrine in physic for practical purpose . the invention of steam engine had a great impact on human civilization . till 1933 rutherford did not believe thatobjectives this chapter contains the detailed discussion on the origin of modern physic and introduces to the subject of failure of classical mechanic and how the quantum theory consolidated the answer for the problem which were remained unanswered by classical theory . the duality of light and the hypothetical argument given by de broglie to explore the wave nature of moving particle and evidence for existence of matter wave are discussed . the main objective of this chapter are to study the failure of classical mechanic and origin of quantum mechanical theory the application of quantum idea to explain black body radiation spectrum photoelectric effect and compton effect the de broglie hypothesis matter wave and experimental evidence given by davison and germer the relation between the group velocity phase velocity particle velocity and velocity of light characteristic of matter waves1 2textbook of engineering physic energy could be tapped from atom . but in 1938 hann and meitner discovered neutroninduced fission reaction of uranium . this is the basis of nuclear weapon and nuclear reactor . the contribution of physic in the development of alternative resource of energy is significant . we are consuming the fossil fuel at such a very fast rate that there is an urgent need to discover new source of energy which are cheap . production of electricity from solar energy and geothermal energy is a reality now but we have a long way to go . another example of physic giving rise to technology is the integrated chip popularly called a ic . the development of newer ic and faster processor made the computer industry to grow leap and bound in the last three decade . computer have become affordable now due to improved production technique and low production cost . the legitimate purpose of technology is to serve people . our society is becoming more and more scienceoriented . we can contribute better to the science and society if we develop a deeper understanding of the basic law of physic . 1.2introduction t o blackbody radia tion spectr um 1.2.1introduction t o modern ph ysics at the end of nineteenth century the physic consisted of mainly newton law of motion and universal gravitation the law of conservation of energy and momentum the law of thermodynamics and maxwell equation for electricity and magnetism were all more or less nearly complete and were used to describe the machine that launched two wave of industrial revolutionthe first one powered by steam and the second one powered by electric current . most of the people believed that there is nothing new to discover in physic now . all that remains is more and more precise measurement . but lord kelvin 18241907 identified two problem with the physic at that time . they were 1 theory of luminiferous eather to explain light wave propagation in space wave theory of light and 2 the inability of electromagnetic theory of light to adequately predict the characteristic of thermal radiation . in the beginning of the 20th century the first problem wa solved by albert einstein by mean of theory of relativity . the major revelation of this theory were that there is no ether there is no absolute space there is no absolute time mass is not conserved energy is not conserved and nothing travel faster than light . for awhile this wa the most revolutionary theory in all of physic . the second problem wa solved by max karl planck 18581947 by mean of quantum mechanical theory . the major revelation of this theory are that all thing are both particle and wave at the same time and that nothing can be predicted or known with absolute certainty . the arrival of these two revolutionary theory divided physic up into two domain . all theory developed before the arrival of relativity and quantum mechanic and any work derived from them are calledclassical physic . all theory derived from the basic principle of relativity and quantum mechanic are called modern physic . the quantum mechanic principle initially could able to explain the following phenomenon successfully blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe photoelectric effect modern physic 3discrete atomic spectrum and the problem of how atom manage to exist radioactive decay 1.2.2blackbody radiation all object radiate electromagnetic energy in the form of heat continuously whatever is their temperature though which frequency predominates depends on the temperature . at room temperature most of the radiation emitted by an object is in the infrared part of the spectrum and hence the emitted radiation are invisible . ablackbody is defined a an object that absorbs all the frequency of electromagnetic radiation falling on it and consequently appears black . a blackbody or perfect absorber is also an ideal radiator which emits radiation in all frequency . such a radiation emittedradiated by a blackbody is called blackbody radiation . in practice a small opening in any heated cavity such a a port in an oven behaves like a blackbody because such an opening trap all incident radiation fig . 1.1. the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody . light entering the small opening strike the far wall where some of it is absorbed but some is reflected at a random angle . the light continues to be reflected and at each reflection a portion of the light is absorbed by the cavity wall . after many reflection essentially all of the incident energy is absorbed . if the direction of the radiation is reversed in fig . 1.1 the light emitted by a small opening is in thermal equilibrium with the wall because it ha been absorbed and reemitted many time . figure 1.1 the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody 1.2.3blackbody radiation spectrum to study the distribution of radiant energy over different frequency the black body is maintained at a constant temperature . by mean of an infrared spectrometer and a bolometerphotodetector the emissive power of the black body for different frequency are measured . the result of the experiment is shown 4textbook of engineering physic in fig . 1.2 a blackbody radiation spectrum . in the spectrum at a given temperature the radiation intensity energy density initially increase with frequency then peak at around a particular frequency and after that decrease finally reach to zero at very high frequency . figure 1.2 blackbody radiation spectrum 1.2.4energy distribution in blackbody radiation spectrum based on the study of the blackbody radiation spectrum following observation can be made 1.the energy is not uniformly distributed with frequency . 2.at a given temperature the energy density initially increase with increase in frequency reach a maximum value and then decrease with further increase in frequency . 3.the frequency corresponding to the maximum energy density peak of the curve shift towards higher frequency side with increase in temperature . 1.2.5laws of blackbody radiation 1.stefans law in 1879 an austrian physicist josef stefan 18351893 found experimentally that the total power modern physic 5per unit area emitted at all frequency by a hot solid etotal is proportional to the fourth power of it absolute temperature . therefore stefans law may be written a 04e e df ttotal f  ...  1.1 whereetotal is the power per unit area emitted at the surface of the blackbody at all frequency efis the power per unit area per unit frequency emitted by the blackbody ti the absolute temperature of the body and is the stefanboltzmann constant given by 5.67 108 w.m2.k4 . a body that is not an ideal radiator will obey the same general law but with a coefficient which ha value less than 1 4 totale t  ...  1.2 2.weins distribution law in 1893wilhelm wien proposed a general form for the blackbody distribution law that gave the correct experimental behavior of max with temperature . this law is called wiens displacement law and may be written a 3 max2.898 10 .t mk  ...  1.3 wheremax is the wavelength in meter corresponding to the blackbody maximum intensity and ti the absolute temperature of the surface of the object emitting the radiation . assuming that the peak sensitivity of the human eye which occurs at about 500 nmbluegreen light coincides with max for the sun a blackbody we can check the consistency of wiens displacement law with stefans law by calculating the sun surface temperature t 3 92.898 10 . 500 10m k m 5800k  ...  1.4 3.weins exponential law in 1893 wein also calculated the energy per unit volume at frequency range f andf df of the radiation within the blackbody cavity uft a 3f tu f t df af e df  ...  1.5 wherea and are wiens constant . this result wa known a wiens exponential law . limitation of weins law experiment show that weins law hold good for shorter wavelength higher frequency region of the spectrum and at higher temperature of the blackbody . it fails to explain the gradual drop of the energy density at longer wavelength lower frequency after the peak value a shown in fig . 1.3 . 6textbook of engineering physic figure 1.3 discrepancy betw eenwiens law and experimental data f or a blackbody at 1500 k 4.rayleighjeans law according to lord rayleigh andjames jean the spectral energy density at frequency range f and f df is simply the density of mode multiplied by kbt or 2 38bf k tu f t df dfc  ...  1.6 wherekb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . limitation of rayleigh jean law the ultraviolet catastrophe a blackbody is an idealized object which absorbs and emits all frequency of radiation . classical physic can be used to derive an equation which describes the intensity of blackbody radiation a a function of frequency for a fixed temperaturethe result is known a the rayleighjeans law . although the rayleighjeans law work for low frequency it diverges a ∆í2 this divergence for high frequency ultraviolet frequency is called the ultraviolet catastrophe . 5.the planck radiation law in 1900max planck wa working on the problem of how the radiation an object emits is related to it temperature . he came up with a formula that agreed very closely with experimental data but the formula only made sense if he assumed that the energy of a vibrating molecule wa quantized that is it could only take on certain value . the energy would have to be proportional to the frequency of vibration and it seemed to come in little chunk of the frequency multiplied by a certain constant . this constant came to be known a planck constant orh and it ha the value h 6.626 1034 j.s . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1918. max planc k discovered the famous blackbody formula which used the quantum theory . accordingly uft is given by modern physic 73 3 8 1 1bhf k thfu f t df df c e  ...  1.7 wherehis planck constant 6.626 1034 .j.s . andkb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . since wiens law hold good in the higher frequency region and rayleighjeans law in the lower frequency region and if plank law could able to explain the energy distribution in entire region of blackbody radiation spectrum then one should able to deduce wiens and rayleighjeans law from plank law . for higher frequency regionbhf k teis very large 1bhf k te 1b bhf hf k t k te e substitute the above approximation in 1.7 we get 3 38 bhf k thfu f t df e dfc compare the above equation with the wiens law we get38 a h c and bhk similarly for lower frequency region f is small implies bhf k t is very small and expandbhf k tea power series we have ve 2 31 11  ...  2 3bhf k t b b bhf hf hfek t k t k t since bhf k t is very small and the higher power term are very small and can be neglected 1bhf k t bhfek t substitute the above result in eqn 1.7 we get the eqn 1.6 which is the rayleighjeans law . hence the expression given by plank valid in the entire frequency region of blackbody radiation spectrum . 1.3photoelectric effect 1.3.1definition the phenomenon of emission of electron from a metal surface when illuminated by light of suitable frequency is called the photoelectric effect . photoelectric effect wa discovered by h. hertz in 1887 . 8textbook of engineering physic the photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy . the electron emitted during photoelectric effect are called photoelectron and the current constituted by photoelectron is called the photoelectric current . the minimum frequency of the incident radiation required for the emission of electron from the surface of a metal is called the threshold frequency of the metal . threshold frequency varies from metal to metal . it ha been observed that metal like zinc cadmium magnesium etc . show photoelectric effect only for ultraviolet light . but some alkali metal like lithium sodium potassium caesium and rubidium show photoelectric effect even for visible light . 1.3.2experimental study vaa eclight ray quartz window figure 1.4 experimental study of photoelectric effect figure 1.5 a graph of photoelectric current verse intensity of light b graph of kinetic energy of electron verse frequency of incident light modern physic 9the experimental setup consists of an evacuated glass tube which contains two electrode a cathodec and an anode a which are sealed inside the tube fig . 1.4. the tube contains a side window of quartz which allows light of reasonably short wavelength to pas through and allows to fall on cathodec . the electron emitted from cathode c will move towards the anode a. this will constitutes the photoelectron and cause photoelectric current to flow in the circuit and measured using a micro ammeter connected in the circuit . the photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the magnitude and sign of the anode potential with respect to the cathode . it is observed that there is a certain minimum negative retarding potential at anode which will reduce the photoelectric current to be zero and is referred a stopping potential or retarding potential or cutoff potential represented a vs. therefore the stopping potential is defined a the minimum negative potential required at the anode so a to completely suppress the photoelectron reaching the anode and hence the current to zero in the circuit . figure 1.6 a plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at two different intensity of incident light b plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at three different frequency of incident light experimental observation 1.photoelectric effect is an instantaneous process . photoelectron will ejected out within 109s very small time after light irradiation on the metal surface . 2.for a given photosensitive material there exist a certain minimum frequency called the cutoff or threshold frequency below which no photoelectric effect take place . 3.for a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation more than threshold frequency the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light a shown in fig . 1.5 a . 4.effect of potential at anode the graph of photoelectric current and the voltage applied between 10textbook of engineering physic the electrode cathode c and anode a show that initially the photoelectric current increase with the increasing potential . for a certain potential the current becomes maximum . for further increase in potential the graph show saturation of current horizontal portion . 5.the value of stopping potential increase with increase in frequency of the incident radiation which is shown in fig . 1.6 b . 6.the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation fig . 1.5 b. it is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation which is a shown fig . 1 . 6 a . 1.3.3laws of photoelectric effect on the basis of the above experiment lenard and millikan gave the following law regarding photoelectric effect 1.the number of photoelectron emitted per second from the metal surface is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light . 2.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron doe not depend upon the intensity of incident light . 3.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron increase linearly with increase in frequency of incident light . 4.if the frequency of incident light is less than certain minimum value then no photoelectron emitted from the metal surface whatever may be the intensity of incident light . this minimum frequency threshold frequency is different for different metal . 5.photoelectric process is instantaneous i.e . there is no timelag between incidence of light and emission of photoelectron . classical physic failed to explain the observed law on the basis of electromagnetic theory . 1.3.4einsteins photoelectric equation to explain the experimental observation of photoelectric effect einstein used plank quantum theory of light light beam consists of photon . he introduced a concept of work function and is nothing but the minimum energy required to make the electron to come out of the metal surface represented by . work function is measured in ev electron volt . work function depends on the property of the metal and the nature of the surface . according to einstein whenever a photon of energyhfis incident on a metal an electron absorbs it instantaneously and if the absorbed energyhf by the electron is greater than the work function binding energy of electron it will come out of the metal surface and then acquire some kinetic energy to move out with a velocityv . the energy of a photon absorbed by the electron is used in two way . ithe part of absorbed photon energy is used in releasing the electron from the metal surface iithe remaining energy appears a the kinetic energy of the electron . thus we can write energy of incident photon binding energy of electron k.e.of electron modern physic 11thenhf ¬Ω mv2 max  ...  1.8 eqn . 1.8 is the einstein photoelectric equation where is called the work function of the given metal . work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to liberate an electron from the surface of the metal . here ¬Ω mv2 max represents the kinetic energy ke . imparted to the electron . k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf  ...  1.9 work function is different for different metal . iff0 is the threshold frequency then hf0  ...  1.10 k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf hf hf0 h f f 0  ...  1.11 explanation of experimental observation using einstein photoelectric equation 1.photoelectric effect is instantaneous process because of collision between two micro particle namely an electron and a photon . 2.kinetic energy of the electron depends on the term ff 0 a seen from equation 1.11. for frequency f f 0 kinetic energy of the electron equal to zero . this frequency f 0 represents the threshold frequency . photoelectron are not emitted if f f 0 . 3.if intense light radiation is incident on a metal surface then it implies that more photon are incident on more electron and hence making more photoelectron to be emitted which increase the photoelectric current . 4.an increase in frequency of the incident radiation increase the energy of the emitted electron a given by einstein equation . the increase in frequency ha no effect on the magnitude of photo current . 5.as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase with frequency it requires large value of retarding potential to stop the electron . if m is the mass and e is the charge of the electron emitted with velocity v and v is the stopping potential then ev ¬Ω mv2 . thus einstein explained photoelectric effect successfully on the basis of particle nature of light and got nobel prize in 1921 . 1.4compton effect in the year 1916 einstein extended his photon concept and proposed that when light interacts with matter not only energy but also linear momentum of photon get transferred in discrete amount and both law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum hold good . the magnitude of momentum transferred with each photon of frequency f is given by p hfc h  ...  1.12 in 1923 arthur compton at washington university carried out an experiment that gave support to the view of einstein . compton arranged for a beam of xrays of wavelength to fall on a target made of graphite and measured the wavelength and intensity of xrays scattered in various direction from the target . the observed phenomenon is called a compton effect . he received nobel prize in 1927 . 12textbook of engineering physic 1.4.1definition when xrays of sharply defined frequency are incident on a material of low atomic number like carbon they suffer a change of frequency on scattering . the scattered beam contains two wavelength . in addition to the expected incident wavelength there exists a component of longer wavelength . this phenomenon is calledcompton effect . the change in wavelength from incident wavelength to scattered xray wavelength is called compton shift . explanation the classical electromagnetic theory failed to explain compton shift but compton successfully used quantum theory of radiation to explain the phenomenon . accordingly the whole process is treated a a particle collision event between xray photon and a loosely bound electron of the scatterer . in this process both momentum and energy are conserved . in this photonelectron collision a portion of the energy of the photon is transferred to the electron . a a result the xray proceeds with less than the original energy and therefore gain lower frequency or higher wavelength . 1.4.2expression for compton shift the incident photon with an energy h fand momentum h fc strike an electron at rest . the initial momentum of the electron is zero and it initial energy is only the rest mass energy m0c2 . the scattered photon of energy h f and momentum h fc move away in a direction inclined at an angle to the original direction a shown in fig . 1.7. after scattering the electron acquires a momentum mv and move at an angle to the original direction . the energy of this recoil electron is mc2 . modern physic 13 figure 1.7 scattering of photon by electron of an atom according to the principle of

eqn . 1.25 show that 1.compton shift is independent of the wavelength of incident radiation . 2.compton shift is independent of the nature of scattering substance . 3.compton shift depends only on the angle of scattering . 4.the wavelength of scattered light is always greater than the wavelength of incident light . based on angle of scattered light three case can be considered case 1 when 0 0 i.e . there is no scattering of photon along the incident direction . case 2 when 90 hm0c 0.02426 √• this is known a compton wavelength . case 3 when 180 2 hm0c 0.04852 √• this is twice of compton wavelength . 1.4.3experiment al verification of com pton shift monochromatic xrays of wavelength are allowed to fall on a scattering material like a small block of carbon . the scattered xrays are received by a bragg spectrometer and their wavelength is determined fig . 1.8. the spectrometer can freely swing in an arc about the scatterer . the wavelength of the scattered xrays is measured for different value of the scattering angle . the experimental result obtained by compton are shown in fig . 1.9. in the scattered radiation in addition to the incident wavelength modern physic 15there exists a line of longer wavelength . the compton shift is found to vary with the angle at which the scattered ray are observed . figure 1.8 schematic diag ram of compton s apparatus figure 1.9 scattered xray intensity versus wavelength of compton scattering at 0 45 90 and 135 16textbook of engineering physic 1.5wave particle du alism various optical phenomenon like reflection refraction interference diffraction and polarization of light can be easily explained by wave theory of light . but the wave theory of light failed to explain the blackbody radiation photoelectric effect and compton effect . these phenomenon can be easily explained by quantum theory of light . this show light appears in both form a to support wave theory at one hand and quantum theory on the other hand . this complex nature of light is said to be dual nature . in quantum theory of light the energy is thought to be in the form of energy packet called photon . the energy carrying particle photon itself exhibit diffraction effect thereby showing wave like character . but this lead to an important conclusion that light possesses dual character i.e . at the same time it behaves like wave and particle . 1.5.1debroglie hypothesis in 1923 louis de broglie pronounced broylee proposed that matter like radiation ha dual nature . that mean the matter which is made up of discrete particle atom proton electron etc . may exhibit wavelike property under appropriate condition . de broglie named these wave associated with material particle a matter wave . in his ph.d. thesis de broglie postulated that because photon have wave and particle characteristic perhaps all form of matter have wave a well a particle property . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1929 for unfolding the existence of wave nature of moving particle . he proposed following similarity for his hypothesis of matter wave 1.nature love symmetry the two form in which nature manifest herself are matter and radiation . we know that radiation possess dual nature so that matter also may show dual nature . physicist have rarely gone wrong by assuming the symmetry of nature . a changing magnetic field produce an electric field in nature and due to symmetry it is also found that a changing electric field produce magnetic field . 2.the close parallelism between mechanic and optic the principle of least action in mechanic state that a moving particle always chooses minimum action path . similarly the fermat principle in optic state that light always chooses a path where the time of transit is minimum . 3.bohrs theory of atomic structure according to bohr theory the stable state of electron in the atom are governed by integer rule . the only phenomenon involving integer in physic are those of interference and mode of vibration of stretched string both of which imply wave motion . hence debroglie thought that the electron may also be characterized by a periodicity like wave . the above similarity suggested that an electron or any other material particle must exhibit wave like property in addition to particlelike property . these wave associated with a material particle are called matter wave . 1.5.2debroglies wavelength the expression for de broglie matter wave can be obtained by considering einstein massenergy relationship and max planck energy equation . modern physic 17according to einstein the relationship between mass and energy of photon moving at a velocity c is given by e mc2  ...  1.26 according to max . plank the energy associated with a photon of frequency f is given by e hf hc  ...  1.27 comparing eqn . 1.26 and 1.27 mc2 hc or hmc  ...  1.28 eqn . 1.28 give the expression for the wavelength of a photon wave that move through a medium when photon travel with a velocity equal to velocity of light c. similarly when any material particle having mass m and moving with velocity v must possess a debroglie wavelength given by hmv  ...  1.29 if the material particle move with kinetic energy e ¬Ωmv2 then de broglie wavelength can be written a 2 h h mvme  ...  1.30 1.5.3 de broglie wavelength extension to electron particle consider an electron of rest mass m0 and charge e accelerated by a potential of v volt from rest to a velocityv . then we write ¬Ω m0v2 ev or 02evvm  ...  1.31 we also know that the wavelength of matter wave a hm0v  ...  1.32 using eqn . 1.31 and 1.32 we write 02h m ev  ...  1.33 putting m0 9.11 1031 kg h 6.62 1034 j and e 1.602 1019 c we get eqn . 1.33 a 12.26√• v  ...  1.34 if the accelerating voltage v 100 volt then the wavelength of electron becomes 1.226 √•. since this wavelength is comparable with the wavelength of xrays the de broglie wave should be capable of being diffracted by a crystal just like xrays . 18textbook of engineering physic 1.5.4davison and germer experiment debroglies prediction of the existence of matter wave is first verified experimentally in 1927 by c. j. davison andl.h . germer of bell telephone laboratory in new york . experimental setup figure 1.10 a schematic diagram of the davisongermer apparatu s the experimental setup is shown in fig . 1.10. electron are produced by heating a filament f by a low tension battery ltb . these electron are accelerated and focused to nickel crystal by applying accelerating voltage v. the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a movable detector . the whole experimental setup is placed inside a vacuum chamber . experimental procedure the beam of electron is allowed to fall normally on the surface of the crystal . due to normal incidence the nickel crystal act like diffraction grating and the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a detector which can be moved to position on a circular scale s and the intensity of electron beam is measured by mean of a galvanometer g. the galvanometer deflection is plotted against the angle between incident beam and the beam entering the detector . the experiment is repeated for different accelerating voltage and resulting curve are drawn . a typical curve obtained for accelerating potential of 54 v is shown in fig . 1.11. modern physic 199060max 50300 40 30 20 10 scatteredintensityarbitraryunits figure 1.11 graph of intensity of diffracted beam versus the angle between incident and diffracted beam for 54 v experimental result the graph remains fairly smooth till the accelerating voltage becomes 44 volt . at 44 volt a spur appears in the graph and a the accelerating voltage is increased the length of the spur increase till the accelerating voltage reach 54 volt at an angle of 50. with further increase in accelerating voltage the spur decrease in length and finally disappears at 68 volt . inference the occurrence of a pronounced spur at 50o with the electron accelerated through 54 volt can be explained a due to constructive interference of the electron wave scattered in this direction from the regularly spaced parallel plane in the nickel crystal . according to debroglies theory the wavelength of the electron accelerated through a potential of 54 volt is given by 12.261.66 . 54√• √• according to the experiment a diffracted beam at colatitude of 50o corresponds to the electron beam glancing angle of 65o with respect to the crystal plane is observed . for nickel the interplanar distance d is found to be 0.91 √• from the xray diffraction study . the order of diffraction is taken to be 1 in this case and applying the bragg equation n 2d sin where n refers to order of diffraction . by simplifying we get 2 0.91 √• sin 50o 1.65 √•. thus the experimental value is in close agreement with the theoretical value . this show that a beam of electron behaves like xrays suffers diffraction at reflecting surface and thus ha wavelike characteristic . 20textbook of engineering physic 1.6matter wave and their chara cteristic property unlike electromagnetic wave the matter wave have following property 1.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to mass of the particle . hence larger the mass of the particle shorter will be the wavelength and vice versa . 2.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to velocity of the particle . hence greater the velocity of the particle smaller will be the wavelength and vice versa . 3.the amplitude of the de broglie wave varies with likelihood of detecting the particle at a particular position . hence the matter wave is termed a probability wave . 4.when a particle is in motion two different velocity are associated with it . they are mechanical motion of particle vparticle and motion of associated matter wave vphase . these two are connected by a relation vphase c2vparticle . now the particle velocity vparticle c. hence the velocity of propagation of matter wave vphase c. thus matter wave can travel greater than velocity of light . 1.6.1phase velocity group velocity and p article velocity according to de broglie each particle of matter like electron proton etc . may be regarded a consisting of group of wave or a wave packet . each component wave propagates with a definite velocity called phase velocity orwave velocity . but when a disturbance consists of a number of component wave each travelling with slightly different velocity the resultant velocity will be that of a periodicity . the velocity of advance of this periodicity is called the group velocity . phase velocity the equation for a wave travelling in positive xdirection is given by sin y a t kx  ...  1.35 wherey is the displacement along ydirection at the instant t is the angular frequency k is the propagation constant and x is the displacement along xaxis at the instant t.in the above equation t kx give the phase of the vibrating particle . the phase quantity t kx is same for the particle which are in the same state of vibration same phase . therefore for those particle which are in the same phase the rate of change of t kx with respect to time is zero i.e . 0dt kxdt or 0dxkdt ordx dt k the velocity with which the phase of the vibrating particle propagates a the wave progress is called phase velocity . here the dx dt is taken a phase velocity . modern

the word science come from a latin word scientia which mean to know . science is the knowledge gained through the systematic observation and experiment . scientific method include the systematic observation reasoning modeling and theoretical prediction . science is divided into two broad category asnatural science andphilosophical science . natural science ha many discipline physic being one of them . the word physic ha it origin in a greek word physis meaning nature . physic is the most basic science which deal with the study of nature and natural phenomenon especially property of matter energy and their interaction . understanding of science begin with understanding of physic . physic is an empirical study . everything we know about physical world and about the principle that govern it behaviour ha been learned through observation of the phenomenon of nature . the ultimate test of any physical theory is it agreement with observation and measurement of physical phenomenon . technology is the application of the doctrine in physic for practical purpose . the invention of steam engine had a great impact on human civilization . till 1933 rutherford did not believe thatobjectives this chapter contains the detailed discussion on the origin of modern physic and introduces to the subject of failure of classical mechanic and how the quantum theory consolidated the answer for the problem which were remained unanswered by classical theory . the duality of light and the hypothetical argument given by de broglie to explore the wave nature of moving particle and evidence for existence of matter wave are discussed . the main objective of this chapter are to study the failure of classical mechanic and origin of quantum mechanical theory the application of quantum idea to explain black body radiation spectrum photoelectric effect and compton effect the de broglie hypothesis matter wave and experimental evidence given by davison and germer the relation between the group velocity phase velocity particle velocity and velocity of light characteristic of matter waves1 2textbook of engineering physic energy could be tapped from atom . but in 1938 hann and meitner discovered neutroninduced fission reaction of uranium . this is the basis of nuclear weapon and nuclear reactor . the contribution of physic in the development of alternative resource of energy is significant . we are consuming the fossil fuel at such a very fast rate that there is an urgent need to discover new source of energy which are cheap . production of electricity from solar energy and geothermal energy is a reality now but we have a long way to go . another example of physic giving rise to technology is the integrated chip popularly called a ic . the development of newer ic and faster processor made the computer industry to grow leap and bound in the last three decade . computer have become affordable now due to improved production technique and low production cost . the legitimate purpose of technology is to serve people . our society is becoming more and more scienceoriented . we can contribute better to the science and society if we develop a deeper understanding of the basic law of physic . 1.2introduction t o blackbody radia tion spectr um 1.2.1introduction t o modern ph ysics at the end of nineteenth century the physic consisted of mainly newton law of motion and universal gravitation the law of conservation of energy and momentum the law of thermodynamics and maxwell equation for electricity and magnetism were all more or less nearly complete and were used to describe the machine that launched two wave of industrial revolutionthe first one powered by steam and the second one powered by electric current . most of the people believed that there is nothing new to discover in physic now . all that remains is more and more precise measurement . but lord kelvin 18241907 identified two problem with the physic at that time . they were 1 theory of luminiferous eather to explain light wave propagation in space wave theory of light and 2 the inability of electromagnetic theory of light to adequately predict the characteristic of thermal radiation . in the beginning of the 20th century the first problem wa solved by albert einstein by mean of theory of relativity . the major revelation of this theory were that there is no ether there is no absolute space there is no absolute time mass is not conserved energy is not conserved and nothing travel faster than light . for awhile this wa the most revolutionary theory in all of physic . the second problem wa solved by max karl planck 18581947 by mean of quantum mechanical theory . the major revelation of this theory are that all thing are both particle and wave at the same time and that nothing can be predicted or known with absolute certainty . the arrival of these two revolutionary theory divided physic up into two domain . all theory developed before the arrival of relativity and quantum mechanic and any work derived from them are calledclassical physic . all theory derived from the basic principle of relativity and quantum mechanic are called modern physic . the quantum mechanic principle initially could able to explain the following phenomenon successfully blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe photoelectric effect modern physic 3discrete atomic spectrum and the problem of how atom manage to exist radioactive decay 1.2.2blackbody radiation all object radiate electromagnetic energy in the form of heat continuously whatever is their temperature though which frequency predominates depends on the temperature . at room temperature most of the radiation emitted by an object is in the infrared part of the spectrum and hence the emitted radiation are invisible . ablackbody is defined a an object that absorbs all the frequency of electromagnetic radiation falling on it and consequently appears black . a blackbody or perfect absorber is also an ideal radiator which emits radiation in all frequency . such a radiation emittedradiated by a blackbody is called blackbody radiation . in practice a small opening in any heated cavity such a a port in an oven behaves like a blackbody because such an opening trap all incident radiation fig . 1.1. the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody . light entering the small opening strike the far wall where some of it is absorbed but some is reflected at a random angle . the light continues to be reflected and at each reflection a portion of the light is absorbed by the cavity wall . after many reflection essentially all of the incident energy is absorbed . if the direction of the radiation is reversed in fig . 1.1 the light emitted by a small opening is in thermal equilibrium with the wall because it ha been absorbed and reemitted many time . figure 1.1 the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody 1.2.3blackbody radiation spectrum to study the distribution of radiant energy over different frequency the black body is maintained at a constant temperature . by mean of an infrared spectrometer and a bolometerphotodetector the emissive power of the black body for different frequency are measured . the result of the experiment is shown 4textbook of engineering physic in fig . 1.2 a blackbody radiation spectrum . in the spectrum at a given temperature the radiation intensity energy density initially increase with frequency then peak at around a particular frequency and after that decrease finally reach to zero at very high frequency . figure 1.2 blackbody radiation spectrum 1.2.4energy distribution in blackbody radiation spectrum based on the study of the blackbody radiation spectrum following observation can be made 1.the energy is not uniformly distributed with frequency . 2.at a given temperature the energy density initially increase with increase in frequency reach a maximum value and then decrease with further increase in frequency . 3.the frequency corresponding to the maximum energy density peak of the curve shift towards higher frequency side with increase in temperature . 1.2.5laws of blackbody radiation 1.stefans law in 1879 an austrian physicist josef stefan 18351893 found experimentally that the total power modern physic 5per unit area emitted at all frequency by a hot solid etotal is proportional to the fourth power of it absolute temperature . therefore stefans law may be written a 04e e df ttotal f  ...  1.1 whereetotal is the power per unit area emitted at the surface of the blackbody at all frequency efis the power per unit area per unit frequency emitted by the blackbody ti the absolute temperature of the body and is the stefanboltzmann constant given by 5.67 108 w.m2.k4 . a body that is not an ideal radiator will obey the same general law but with a coefficient which ha value less than 1 4 totale t  ...  1.2 2.weins distribution law in 1893wilhelm wien proposed a general form for the blackbody distribution law that gave the correct experimental behavior of max with temperature . this law is called wiens displacement law and may be written a 3 max2.898 10 .t mk  ...  1.3 wheremax is the wavelength in meter corresponding to the blackbody maximum intensity and ti the absolute temperature of the surface of the object emitting the radiation . assuming that the peak sensitivity of the human eye which occurs at about 500 nmbluegreen light coincides with max for the sun a blackbody we can check the consistency of wiens displacement law with stefans law by calculating the sun surface temperature t 3 92.898 10 . 500 10m k m 5800k  ...  1.4 3.weins exponential law in 1893 wein also calculated the energy per unit volume at frequency range f andf df of the radiation within the blackbody cavity uft a 3f tu f t df af e df  ...  1.5 wherea and are wiens constant . this result wa known a wiens exponential law . limitation of weins law experiment show that weins law hold good for shorter wavelength higher frequency region of the spectrum and at higher temperature of the blackbody . it fails to explain the gradual drop of the energy density at longer wavelength lower frequency after the peak value a shown in fig . 1.3 . 6textbook of engineering physic figure 1.3 discrepancy betw eenwiens law and experimental data f or a blackbody at 1500 k 4.rayleighjeans law according to lord rayleigh andjames jean the spectral energy density at frequency range f and f df is simply the density of mode multiplied by kbt or 2 38bf k tu f t df dfc  ...  1.6 wherekb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . limitation of rayleigh jean law the ultraviolet catastrophe a blackbody is an idealized object which absorbs and emits all frequency of radiation . classical physic can be used to derive an equation which describes the intensity of blackbody radiation a a function of frequency for a fixed temperaturethe result is known a the rayleighjeans law . although the rayleighjeans law work for low frequency it diverges a ∆í2 this divergence for high frequency ultraviolet frequency is called the ultraviolet catastrophe . 5.the planck radiation law in 1900max planck wa working on the problem of how the radiation an object emits is related to it temperature . he came up with a formula that agreed very closely with experimental data but the formula only made sense if he assumed that the energy of a vibrating molecule wa quantized that is it could only take on certain value . the energy would have to be proportional to the frequency of vibration and it seemed to come in little chunk of the frequency multiplied by a certain constant . this constant came to be known a planck constant orh and it ha the value h 6.626 1034 j.s . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1918. max planc k discovered the famous blackbody formula which used the quantum theory . accordingly uft is given by modern physic 73 3 8 1 1bhf k thfu f t df df c e  ...  1.7 wherehis planck constant 6.626 1034 .j.s . andkb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . since wiens law hold good in the higher frequency region and rayleighjeans law in the lower frequency region and if plank law could able to explain the energy distribution in entire region of blackbody radiation spectrum then one should able to deduce wiens and rayleighjeans law from plank law . for higher frequency regionbhf k teis very large 1bhf k te 1b bhf hf k t k te e substitute the above approximation in 1.7 we get 3 38 bhf k thfu f t df e dfc compare the above equation with the wiens law we get38 a h c and bhk similarly for lower frequency region f is small implies bhf k t is very small and expandbhf k tea power series we have ve 2 31 11  ...  2 3bhf k t b b bhf hf hfek t k t k t since bhf k t is very small and the higher power term are very small and can be neglected 1bhf k t bhfek t substitute the above result in eqn 1.7 we get the eqn 1.6 which is the rayleighjeans law . hence the expression given by plank valid in the entire frequency region of blackbody radiation spectrum . 1.3photoelectric effect 1.3.1definition the phenomenon of emission of electron from a metal surface when illuminated by light of suitable frequency is called the photoelectric effect . photoelectric effect wa discovered by h. hertz in 1887 . 8textbook of engineering physic the photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy . the electron emitted during photoelectric effect are called photoelectron and the current constituted by photoelectron is called the photoelectric current . the minimum frequency of the incident radiation required for the emission of electron from the surface of a metal is called the threshold frequency of the metal . threshold frequency varies from metal to metal . it ha been observed that metal like zinc cadmium magnesium etc . show photoelectric effect only for ultraviolet light . but some alkali metal like lithium sodium potassium caesium and rubidium show photoelectric effect even for visible light . 1.3.2experimental study vaa eclight ray quartz window figure 1.4 experimental study of photoelectric effect figure 1.5 a graph of photoelectric current verse intensity of light b graph of kinetic energy of electron verse frequency of incident light modern physic 9the experimental setup consists of an evacuated glass tube which contains two electrode a cathodec and an anode a which are sealed inside the tube fig . 1.4. the tube contains a side window of quartz which allows light of reasonably short wavelength to pas through and allows to fall on cathodec . the electron emitted from cathode c will move towards the anode a. this will constitutes the photoelectron and cause photoelectric current to flow in the circuit and measured using a micro ammeter connected in the circuit . the photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the magnitude and sign of the anode potential with respect to the cathode . it is observed that there is a certain minimum negative retarding potential at anode which will reduce the photoelectric current to be zero and is referred a stopping potential or retarding potential or cutoff potential represented a vs. therefore the stopping potential is defined a the minimum negative potential required at the anode so a to completely suppress the photoelectron reaching the anode and hence the current to zero in the circuit . figure 1.6 a plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at two different intensity of incident light b plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at three different frequency of incident light experimental observation 1.photoelectric effect is an instantaneous process . photoelectron will ejected out within 109s very small time after light irradiation on the metal surface . 2.for a given photosensitive material there exist a certain minimum frequency called the cutoff or threshold frequency below which no photoelectric effect take place . 3.for a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation more than threshold frequency the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light a shown in fig . 1.5 a . 4.effect of potential at anode the graph of photoelectric current and the voltage applied between 10textbook of engineering physic the electrode cathode c and anode a show that initially the photoelectric current increase with the increasing potential . for a certain potential the current becomes maximum . for further increase in potential the graph show saturation of current horizontal portion . 5.the value of stopping potential increase with increase in frequency of the incident radiation which is shown in fig . 1.6 b . 6.the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation fig . 1.5 b. it is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation which is a shown fig . 1 . 6 a . 1.3.3laws of photoelectric effect on the basis of the above experiment lenard and millikan gave the following law regarding photoelectric effect 1.the number of photoelectron emitted per second from the metal surface is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light . 2.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron doe not depend upon the intensity of incident light . 3.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron increase linearly with increase in frequency of incident light . 4.if the frequency of incident light is less than certain minimum value then no photoelectron emitted from the metal surface whatever may be the intensity of incident light . this minimum frequency threshold frequency is different for different metal . 5.photoelectric process is instantaneous i.e . there is no timelag between incidence of light and emission of photoelectron . classical physic failed to explain the observed law on the basis of electromagnetic theory . 1.3.4einsteins photoelectric equation to explain the experimental observation of photoelectric effect einstein used plank quantum theory of light light beam consists of photon . he introduced a concept of work function and is nothing but the minimum energy required to make the electron to come out of the metal surface represented by . work function is measured in ev electron volt . work function depends on the property of the metal and the nature of the surface . according to einstein whenever a photon of energyhfis incident on a metal an electron absorbs it instantaneously and if the absorbed energyhf by the electron is greater than the work function binding energy of electron it will come out of the metal surface and then acquire some kinetic energy to move out with a velocityv . the energy of a photon absorbed by the electron is used in two way . ithe part of absorbed photon energy is used in releasing the electron from the metal surface iithe remaining energy appears a the kinetic energy of the electron . thus we can write energy of incident photon binding energy of electron k.e.of electron modern physic 11thenhf ¬Ω mv2 max  ...  1.8 eqn . 1.8 is the einstein photoelectric equation where is called the work function of the given metal . work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to liberate an electron from the surface of the metal . here ¬Ω mv2 max represents the kinetic energy ke . imparted to the electron . k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf  ...  1.9 work function is different for different metal . iff0 is the threshold frequency then hf0  ...  1.10 k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf hf hf0 h f f 0  ...  1.11 explanation of experimental observation using einstein photoelectric equation 1.photoelectric effect is instantaneous process because of collision between two micro particle namely an electron and a photon . 2.kinetic energy of the electron depends on the term ff 0 a seen from equation 1.11. for frequency f f 0 kinetic energy of the electron equal to zero . this frequency f 0 represents the threshold frequency . photoelectron are not emitted if f f 0 . 3.if intense light radiation is incident on a metal surface then it implies that more photon are incident on more electron and hence making more photoelectron to be emitted which increase the photoelectric current . 4.an increase in frequency of the incident radiation increase the energy of the emitted electron a given by einstein equation . the increase in frequency ha no effect on the magnitude of photo current . 5.as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase with frequency it requires large value of retarding potential to stop the electron . if m is the mass and e is the charge of the electron emitted with velocity v and v is the stopping potential then ev ¬Ω mv2 . thus einstein explained photoelectric effect successfully on the basis of particle nature of light and got nobel prize in 1921 . 1.4compton effect in the year 1916 einstein extended his photon concept and proposed that when light interacts with matter not only energy but also linear momentum of photon get transferred in discrete amount and both law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum hold good . the magnitude of momentum transferred with each photon of frequency f is given by p hfc h  ...  1.12 in 1923 arthur compton at washington university carried out an experiment that gave support to the view of einstein . compton arranged for a beam of xrays of wavelength to fall on a target made of graphite and measured the wavelength and intensity of xrays scattered in various direction from the target . the observed phenomenon is called a compton effect . he received nobel prize in 1927 . 12textbook of engineering physic 1.4.1definition when xrays of sharply defined frequency are incident on a material of low atomic number like carbon they suffer a change of frequency on scattering . the scattered beam contains two wavelength . in addition to the expected incident wavelength there exists a component of longer wavelength . this phenomenon is calledcompton effect . the change in wavelength from incident wavelength to scattered xray wavelength is called compton shift . explanation the classical electromagnetic theory failed to explain compton shift but compton successfully used quantum theory of radiation to explain the phenomenon . accordingly the whole process is treated a a particle collision event between xray photon and a loosely bound electron of the scatterer . in this process both momentum and energy are conserved . in this photonelectron collision a portion of the energy of the photon is transferred to the electron . a a result the xray proceeds with less than the original energy and therefore gain lower frequency or higher wavelength . 1.4.2expression for compton shift the incident photon with an energy h fand momentum h fc strike an electron at rest . the initial momentum of the electron is zero and it initial energy is only the rest mass energy m0c2 . the scattered photon of energy h f and momentum h fc move away in a direction inclined at an angle to the original direction a shown in fig . 1.7. after scattering the electron acquires a momentum mv and move at an angle to the original direction . the energy of this recoil electron is mc2 . modern physic 13 figure 1.7 scattering of photon by electron of an atom according to the principle of

eqn . 1.25 show that 1.compton shift is independent of the wavelength of incident radiation . 2.compton shift is independent of the nature of scattering substance . 3.compton shift depends only on the angle of scattering . 4.the wavelength of scattered light is always greater than the wavelength of incident light . based on angle of scattered light three case can be considered case 1 when 0 0 i.e . there is no scattering of photon along the incident direction . case 2 when 90 hm0c 0.02426 √• this is known a compton wavelength . case 3 when 180 2 hm0c 0.04852 √• this is twice of compton wavelength . 1.4.3experiment al verification of com pton shift monochromatic xrays of wavelength are allowed to fall on a scattering material like a small block of carbon . the scattered xrays are received by a bragg spectrometer and their wavelength is determined fig . 1.8. the spectrometer can freely swing in an arc about the scatterer . the wavelength of the scattered xrays is measured for different value of the scattering angle . the experimental result obtained by compton are shown in fig . 1.9. in the scattered radiation in addition to the incident wavelength modern physic 15there exists a line of longer wavelength . the compton shift is found to vary with the angle at which the scattered ray are observed . figure 1.8 schematic diag ram of compton s apparatus figure 1.9 scattered xray intensity versus wavelength of compton scattering at 0 45 90 and 135 16textbook of engineering physic 1.5wave particle du alism various optical phenomenon like reflection refraction interference diffraction and polarization of light can be easily explained by wave theory of light . but the wave theory of light failed to explain the blackbody radiation photoelectric effect and compton effect . these phenomenon can be easily explained by quantum theory of light . this show light appears in both form a to support wave theory at one hand and quantum theory on the other hand . this complex nature of light is said to be dual nature . in quantum theory of light the energy is thought to be in the form of energy packet called photon . the energy carrying particle photon itself exhibit diffraction effect thereby showing wave like character . but this lead to an important conclusion that light possesses dual character i.e . at the same time it behaves like wave and particle . 1.5.1debroglie hypothesis in 1923 louis de broglie pronounced broylee proposed that matter like radiation ha dual nature . that mean the matter which is made up of discrete particle atom proton electron etc . may exhibit wavelike property under appropriate condition . de broglie named these wave associated with material particle a matter wave . in his ph.d. thesis de broglie postulated that because photon have wave and particle characteristic perhaps all form of matter have wave a well a particle property . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1929 for unfolding the existence of wave nature of moving particle . he proposed following similarity for his hypothesis of matter wave 1.nature love symmetry the two form in which nature manifest herself are matter and radiation . we know that radiation possess dual nature so that matter also may show dual nature . physicist have rarely gone wrong by assuming the symmetry of nature . a changing magnetic field produce an electric field in nature and due to symmetry it is also found that a changing electric field produce magnetic field . 2.the close parallelism between mechanic and optic the principle of least action in mechanic state that a moving particle always chooses minimum action path . similarly the fermat principle in optic state that light always chooses a path where the time of transit is minimum . 3.bohrs theory of atomic structure according to bohr theory the stable state of electron in the atom are governed by integer rule . the only phenomenon involving integer in physic are those of interference and mode of vibration of stretched string both of which imply wave motion . hence debroglie thought that the electron may also be characterized by a periodicity like wave . the above similarity suggested that an electron or any other material particle must exhibit wave like property in addition to particlelike property . these wave associated with a material particle are called matter wave . 1.5.2debroglies wavelength the expression for de broglie matter wave can be obtained by considering einstein massenergy relationship and max planck energy equation . modern physic 17according to einstein the relationship between mass and energy of photon moving at a velocity c is given by e mc2  ...  1.26 according to max . plank the energy associated with a photon of frequency f is given by e hf hc  ...  1.27 comparing eqn . 1.26 and 1.27 mc2 hc or hmc  ...  1.28 eqn . 1.28 give the expression for the wavelength of a photon wave that move through a medium when photon travel with a velocity equal to velocity of light c. similarly when any material particle having mass m and moving with velocity v must possess a debroglie wavelength given by hmv  ...  1.29 if the material particle move with kinetic energy e ¬Ωmv2 then de broglie wavelength can be written a 2 h h mvme  ...  1.30 1.5.3 de broglie wavelength extension to electron particle consider an electron of rest mass m0 and charge e accelerated by a potential of v volt from rest to a velocityv . then we write ¬Ω m0v2 ev or 02evvm  ...  1.31 we also know that the wavelength of matter wave a hm0v  ...  1.32 using eqn . 1.31 and 1.32 we write 02h m ev  ...  1.33 putting m0 9.11 1031 kg h 6.62 1034 j and e 1.602 1019 c we get eqn . 1.33 a 12.26√• v  ...  1.34 if the accelerating voltage v 100 volt then the wavelength of electron becomes 1.226 √•. since this wavelength is comparable with the wavelength of xrays the de broglie wave should be capable of being diffracted by a crystal just like xrays . 18textbook of engineering physic 1.5.4davison and germer experiment debroglies prediction of the existence of matter wave is first verified experimentally in 1927 by c. j. davison andl.h . germer of bell telephone laboratory in new york . experimental setup figure 1.10 a schematic diagram of the davisongermer apparatu s the experimental setup is shown in fig . 1.10. electron are produced by heating a filament f by a low tension battery ltb . these electron are accelerated and focused to nickel crystal by applying accelerating voltage v. the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a movable detector . the whole experimental setup is placed inside a vacuum chamber . experimental procedure the beam of electron is allowed to fall normally on the surface of the crystal . due to normal incidence the nickel crystal act like diffraction grating and the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a detector which can be moved to position on a circular scale s and the intensity of electron beam is measured by mean of a galvanometer g. the galvanometer deflection is plotted against the angle between incident beam and the beam entering the detector . the experiment is repeated for different accelerating voltage and resulting curve are drawn . a typical curve obtained for accelerating potential of 54 v is shown in fig . 1.11. modern physic 199060max 50300 40 30 20 10 scatteredintensityarbitraryunits figure 1.11 graph of intensity of diffracted beam versus the angle between incident and diffracted beam for 54 v experimental result the graph remains fairly smooth till the accelerating voltage becomes 44 volt . at 44 volt a spur appears in the graph and a the accelerating voltage is increased the length of the spur increase till the accelerating voltage reach 54 volt at an angle of 50. with further increase in accelerating voltage the spur decrease in length and finally disappears at 68 volt . inference the occurrence of a pronounced spur at 50o with the electron accelerated through 54 volt can be explained a due to constructive interference of the electron wave scattered in this direction from the regularly spaced parallel plane in the nickel crystal . according to debroglies theory the wavelength of the electron accelerated through a potential of 54 volt is given by 12.261.66 . 54√• √• according to the experiment a diffracted beam at colatitude of 50o corresponds to the electron beam glancing angle of 65o with respect to the crystal plane is observed . for nickel the interplanar distance d is found to be 0.91 √• from the xray diffraction study . the order of diffraction is taken to be 1 in this case and applying the bragg equation n 2d sin where n refers to order of diffraction . by simplifying we get 2 0.91 √• sin 50o 1.65 √•. thus the experimental value is in close agreement with the theoretical value . this show that a beam of electron behaves like xrays suffers diffraction at reflecting surface and thus ha wavelike characteristic . 20textbook of engineering physic 1.6matter wave and their chara cteristic property unlike electromagnetic wave the matter wave have following property 1.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to mass of the particle . hence larger the mass of the particle shorter will be the wavelength and vice versa . 2.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to velocity of the particle . hence greater the velocity of the particle smaller will be the wavelength and vice versa . 3.the amplitude of the de broglie wave varies with likelihood of detecting the particle at a particular position . hence the matter wave is termed a probability wave . 4.when a particle is in motion two different velocity are associated with it . they are mechanical motion of particle vparticle and motion of associated matter wave vphase . these two are connected by a relation vphase c2vparticle . now the particle velocity vparticle c. hence the velocity of propagation of matter wave vphase c. thus matter wave can travel greater than velocity of light . 1.6.1phase velocity group velocity and p article velocity according to de broglie each particle of matter like electron proton etc . may be regarded a consisting of group of wave or a wave packet . each component wave propagates with a definite velocity called phase velocity orwave velocity . but when a disturbance consists of a number of component wave each travelling with slightly different velocity the resultant velocity will be that of a periodicity . the velocity of advance of this periodicity is called the group velocity . phase velocity the equation for a wave travelling in positive xdirection is given by sin y a t kx  ...  1.35 wherey is the displacement along ydirection at the instant t is the angular frequency k is the propagation constant and x is the displacement along xaxis at the instant t.in the above equation t kx give the phase of the vibrating particle . the phase quantity t kx is same for the particle which are in the same state of vibration same phase . therefore for those particle which are in the same phase the rate of change of t kx with respect to time is zero i.e . 0dt kxdt or 0dxkdt ordx dt k the velocity with which the phase of the vibrating particle propagates a the wave progress is called phase velocity . here the dx dt is taken a phase velocity . modern physic 21phasevk group velocity definition the velocity with which the wave packet formed due to the superposition of two or more travelling wave of slightly different frequency is transported is called group velocity . vg figure 1.12 illustration on group velocity consider two travelling wave y1 andy2 of same amplitude with slightly difference in their wavelength and are given by 1 1 1sin y a

of them . the word physic ha it origin in a greek word physis meaning nature . physic is the most basic science which deal with the study of nature and natural phenomenon especially property of matter energy and their interaction . understanding of science begin with understanding of physic . physic is an empirical study . everything we know about physical world and about the principle that govern it behaviour ha been learned through observation of the phenomenon of nature . the ultimate test of any physical theory is it agreement with observation and measurement of physical phenomenon . technology is the application of the doctrine in physic for practical purpose . the invention of steam engine had a great impact on human civilization . till 1933 rutherford did not believe thatobjectives this chapter contains the detailed discussion on the origin of modern physic and introduces to the subject of failure of classical mechanic and how the quantum theory consolidated the answer for the problem which were remained unanswered by classical theory . the duality of light and the hypothetical argument given by de broglie to explore the wave nature of moving particle and evidence for existence of matter wave are discussed . the main objective of this chapter are to study the failure of classical mechanic and origin of quantum mechanical theory the application of quantum idea to explain black body radiation spectrum photoelectric effect and compton effect the de broglie hypothesis matter wave and experimental evidence given by davison and germer the relation between the group velocity phase velocity particle velocity and velocity of light characteristic of matter waves1 2textbook of engineering physic energy could be tapped from atom . but in 1938 hann and meitner discovered neutroninduced fission reaction of uranium . this is the basis of nuclear weapon and nuclear reactor . the contribution of physic in the development of alternative resource of energy is significant . we are consuming the fossil fuel at such a very fast rate that there is an urgent need to discover new source of energy which are cheap . production of electricity from solar energy and geothermal energy is a reality now but we have a long way to go . another example of physic giving rise to technology is the integrated chip popularly called a ic . the development of newer ic and faster processor made the computer industry to grow leap and bound in the last three decade . computer have become affordable now due to improved production technique and low production cost . the legitimate purpose of technology is to serve people . our society is becoming more and more scienceoriented . we can contribute better to the science and society if we develop a deeper understanding of the basic law of physic . 1.2introduction t o blackbody radia tion spectr um 1.2.1introduction t o modern ph ysics at the end of nineteenth century the physic consisted of mainly newton law of motion and universal gravitation the law of conservation of energy and momentum the law of thermodynamics and maxwell equation for electricity and magnetism were all more or less nearly complete and were used to describe the machine that launched two wave of industrial revolutionthe first one powered by steam and the second one powered by electric current . most of the people believed that there is nothing new to discover in physic now . all that remains is more and more precise measurement . but lord kelvin 18241907 identified two problem with the physic at that time . they were 1 theory of luminiferous eather to explain light wave propagation in space wave theory of light and 2 the inability of electromagnetic theory of light to adequately predict the characteristic of thermal radiation . in the beginning of the 20th century the first problem wa solved by albert einstein by mean of theory of relativity . the major revelation of this theory were that there is no ether there is no absolute space there is no absolute time mass is not conserved energy is not conserved and nothing travel faster than light . for awhile this wa the most revolutionary theory in all of physic . the second problem wa solved by max karl planck 18581947 by mean of quantum mechanical theory . the major revelation of this theory are that all thing are both particle and wave at the same time and that nothing can be predicted or known with absolute certainty . the arrival of these two revolutionary theory divided physic up into two domain . all theory developed before the arrival of relativity and quantum mechanic and any work derived from them are calledclassical physic . all theory derived from the basic principle of relativity and quantum mechanic are called modern physic . the quantum mechanic principle initially could able to explain the following phenomenon successfully blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe photoelectric effect modern physic 3discrete atomic spectrum and the problem of how atom manage to exist radioactive decay 1.2.2blackbody radiation all object radiate electromagnetic energy in the form of heat continuously whatever is their temperature though which frequency predominates depends on the temperature . at room temperature most of the radiation emitted by an object is in the infrared part of the spectrum and hence the emitted radiation are invisible . ablackbody is defined a an object that absorbs all the frequency of electromagnetic radiation falling on it and consequently appears black . a blackbody or perfect absorber is also an ideal radiator which emits radiation in all frequency . such a radiation emittedradiated by a blackbody is called blackbody radiation . in practice a small opening in any heated cavity such a a port in an oven behaves like a blackbody because such an opening trap all incident radiation fig . 1.1. the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody . light entering the small opening strike the far wall where some of it is absorbed but some is reflected at a random angle . the light continues to be reflected and at each reflection a portion of the light is absorbed by the cavity wall . after many reflection essentially all of the incident energy is absorbed . if the direction of the radiation is reversed in fig . 1.1 the light emitted by a small opening is in thermal equilibrium with the wall because it ha been absorbed and reemitted many time . figure 1.1 the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody 1.2.3blackbody radiation spectrum to study the distribution of radiant energy over different frequency the black body is maintained at a constant temperature . by mean of an infrared spectrometer and a bolometerphotodetector the emissive power of the black body for different frequency are measured . the result of the experiment is shown 4textbook of engineering physic in fig . 1.2 a blackbody radiation spectrum . in the spectrum at a given temperature the radiation intensity energy density initially increase with frequency then peak at around a particular frequency and after that decrease finally reach to zero at very high frequency . figure 1.2 blackbody radiation spectrum 1.2.4energy distribution in blackbody radiation spectrum based on the study of the blackbody radiation spectrum following observation can be made 1.the energy is not uniformly distributed with frequency . 2.at a given temperature the energy density initially increase with increase in frequency reach a maximum value and then decrease with further increase in frequency . 3.the frequency corresponding to the maximum energy density peak of the curve shift towards higher frequency side with increase in temperature . 1.2.5laws of blackbody radiation 1.stefans law in 1879 an austrian physicist josef stefan 18351893 found experimentally that the total power modern physic 5per unit area emitted at all frequency by a hot solid etotal is proportional to the fourth power of it absolute temperature . therefore stefans law may be written a 04e e df ttotal f  ...  1.1 whereetotal is the power per unit area emitted at the surface of the blackbody at all frequency efis the power per unit area per unit frequency emitted by the blackbody ti the absolute temperature of the body and is the stefanboltzmann constant given by 5.67 108 w.m2.k4 . a body that is not an ideal radiator will obey the same general law but with a coefficient which ha value less than 1 4 totale t  ...  1.2 2.weins distribution law in 1893wilhelm wien proposed a general form for the blackbody distribution law that gave the correct experimental behavior of max with temperature . this law is called wiens displacement law and may be written a 3 max2.898 10 .t mk  ...  1.3 wheremax is the wavelength in meter corresponding to the blackbody maximum intensity and ti the absolute temperature of the surface of the object emitting the radiation . assuming that the peak sensitivity of the human eye which occurs at about 500 nmbluegreen light coincides with max for the sun a blackbody we can check the consistency of wiens displacement law with stefans law by calculating the sun surface temperature t 3 92.898 10 . 500 10m k m 5800k  ...  1.4 3.weins exponential law in 1893 wein also calculated the energy per unit volume at frequency range f andf df of the radiation within the blackbody cavity uft a 3f tu f t df af e df  ...  1.5 wherea and are wiens constant . this result wa known a wiens exponential law . limitation of weins law experiment show that weins law hold good for shorter wavelength higher frequency region of the spectrum and at higher temperature of the blackbody . it fails to explain the gradual drop of the energy density at longer wavelength lower frequency after the peak value a shown in fig . 1.3 . 6textbook of engineering physic figure 1.3 discrepancy betw eenwiens law and experimental data f or a blackbody at 1500 k 4.rayleighjeans law according to lord rayleigh andjames jean the spectral energy density at frequency range f and f df is simply the density of mode multiplied by kbt or 2 38bf k tu f t df dfc  ...  1.6 wherekb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . limitation of rayleigh jean law the ultraviolet catastrophe a blackbody is an idealized object which absorbs and emits all frequency of radiation . classical physic can be used to derive an equation which describes the intensity of blackbody radiation a a function of frequency for a fixed temperaturethe result is known a the rayleighjeans law . although the rayleighjeans law work for low frequency it diverges a ∆í2 this divergence for high frequency ultraviolet frequency is called the ultraviolet catastrophe . 5.the planck radiation law in 1900max planck wa working on the problem of how the radiation an object emits is related to it temperature . he came up with a formula that agreed very closely with experimental data but the formula only made sense if he assumed that the energy of a vibrating molecule wa quantized that is it could only take on certain value . the energy would have to be proportional to the frequency of vibration and it seemed to come in little chunk of the frequency multiplied by a certain constant . this constant came to be known a planck constant orh and it ha the value h 6.626 1034 j.s . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1918. max planc k discovered the famous blackbody formula which used the quantum theory . accordingly uft is given by modern physic 73 3 8 1 1bhf k thfu f t df df c e  ...  1.7 wherehis planck constant 6.626 1034 .j.s . andkb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . since wiens law hold good in the higher frequency region and rayleighjeans law in the lower frequency region and if plank law could able to explain the energy distribution in entire region of blackbody radiation spectrum then one should able to deduce wiens and rayleighjeans law from plank law . for higher frequency regionbhf k teis very large 1bhf k te 1b bhf hf k t k te e substitute the above approximation in 1.7 we get 3 38 bhf k thfu f t df e dfc compare the above equation with the wiens law we get38 a h c and bhk similarly for lower frequency region f is small implies bhf k t is very small and expandbhf k tea power series we have ve 2 31 11  ...  2 3bhf k t b b bhf hf hfek t k t k t since bhf k t is very small and the higher power term are very small and can be neglected 1bhf k t bhfek t substitute the above result in eqn 1.7 we get the eqn 1.6 which is the rayleighjeans law . hence the expression given by plank valid in the entire frequency region of blackbody radiation spectrum . 1.3photoelectric effect 1.3.1definition the phenomenon of emission of electron from a metal surface when illuminated by light of suitable frequency is called the photoelectric effect . photoelectric effect wa discovered by h. hertz in 1887 . 8textbook of engineering physic the photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy . the electron emitted during photoelectric effect are called photoelectron and the current constituted by photoelectron is called the photoelectric current . the minimum frequency of the incident radiation required for the emission of electron from the surface of a metal is called the threshold frequency of the metal . threshold frequency varies from metal to metal . it ha been observed that metal like zinc cadmium magnesium etc . show photoelectric effect only for ultraviolet light . but some alkali metal like lithium sodium potassium caesium and rubidium show photoelectric effect even for visible light . 1.3.2experimental study vaa eclight ray quartz window figure 1.4 experimental study of photoelectric effect figure 1.5 a graph of photoelectric current verse intensity of light b graph of kinetic energy of electron verse frequency of incident light modern physic 9the experimental setup consists of an evacuated glass tube which contains two electrode a cathodec and an anode a which are sealed inside the tube fig . 1.4. the tube contains a side window of quartz which allows light of reasonably short wavelength to pas through and allows to fall on cathodec . the electron emitted from cathode c will move towards the anode a. this will constitutes the photoelectron and cause photoelectric current to flow in the circuit and measured using a micro ammeter connected in the circuit . the photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the magnitude and sign of the anode potential with respect to the cathode . it is observed that there is a certain minimum negative retarding potential at anode which will reduce the photoelectric current to be zero and is referred a stopping potential or retarding potential or cutoff potential represented a vs. therefore the stopping potential is defined a the minimum negative potential required at the anode so a to completely suppress the photoelectron reaching the anode and hence the current to zero in the circuit . figure 1.6 a plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at two different intensity of incident light b plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at three different frequency of incident light experimental observation 1.photoelectric effect is an instantaneous process . photoelectron will ejected out within 109s very small time after light irradiation on the metal surface . 2.for a given photosensitive material there exist a certain minimum frequency called the cutoff or threshold frequency below which no photoelectric effect take place . 3.for a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation more than threshold frequency the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light a shown in fig . 1.5 a . 4.effect of potential at anode the graph of photoelectric current and the voltage applied between 10textbook of engineering physic the electrode cathode c and anode a show that initially the photoelectric current increase with the increasing potential . for a certain potential the current becomes maximum . for further increase in potential the graph show saturation of current horizontal portion . 5.the value of stopping potential increase with increase in frequency of the incident radiation which is shown in fig . 1.6 b . 6.the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation fig . 1.5 b. it is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation which is a shown fig . 1 . 6 a . 1.3.3laws of photoelectric effect on the basis of the above experiment lenard and millikan gave the following law regarding photoelectric effect 1.the number of photoelectron emitted per second from the metal surface is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light . 2.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron doe not depend upon the intensity of incident light . 3.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron increase linearly with increase in frequency of incident light . 4.if the frequency of incident light is less than certain minimum value then no photoelectron emitted from the metal surface whatever may be the intensity of incident light . this minimum frequency threshold frequency is different for different metal . 5.photoelectric process is instantaneous i.e . there is no timelag between incidence of light and emission of photoelectron . classical physic failed to explain the observed law on the basis of electromagnetic theory . 1.3.4einsteins photoelectric equation to explain the experimental observation of photoelectric effect einstein used plank quantum theory of light light beam consists of photon . he introduced a concept of work function and is nothing but the minimum energy required to make the electron to come out of the metal surface represented by . work function is measured in ev electron volt . work function depends on the property of the metal and the nature of the surface . according to einstein whenever a photon of energyhfis incident on a metal an electron absorbs it instantaneously and if the absorbed energyhf by the electron is greater than the work function binding energy of electron it will come out of the metal surface and then acquire some kinetic energy to move out with a velocityv . the energy of a photon absorbed by the electron is used in two way . ithe part of absorbed photon energy is used in releasing the electron from the metal surface iithe remaining energy appears a the kinetic energy of the electron . thus we can write energy of incident photon binding energy of electron k.e.of electron modern physic 11thenhf ¬Ω mv2 max  ...  1.8 eqn . 1.8 is the einstein photoelectric equation where is called the work function of the given metal . work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to liberate an electron from the surface of the metal . here ¬Ω mv2 max represents the kinetic energy ke . imparted to the electron . k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf  ...  1.9 work function is different for different metal . iff0 is the threshold frequency then hf0  ...  1.10 k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf hf hf0 h f f 0  ...  1.11 explanation of experimental observation using einstein photoelectric equation 1.photoelectric effect is instantaneous process because of collision between two micro particle namely an electron and a photon . 2.kinetic energy of the electron depends on the term ff 0 a seen from equation 1.11. for frequency f f 0 kinetic energy of the electron equal to zero . this frequency f 0 represents the threshold frequency . photoelectron are not emitted if f f 0 . 3.if intense light radiation is incident on a metal surface then it implies that more photon are incident on more electron and hence making more photoelectron to be emitted which increase the photoelectric current . 4.an increase in frequency of the incident radiation increase the energy of the emitted electron a given by einstein equation . the increase in frequency ha no effect on the magnitude of photo current . 5.as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase with frequency it requires large value of retarding potential to stop the electron . if m is the mass and e is the charge of the electron emitted with velocity v and v is the stopping potential then ev ¬Ω mv2 . thus einstein explained photoelectric effect successfully on the basis of particle nature of light and got nobel prize in 1921 . 1.4compton effect in the year 1916 einstein extended his photon concept and proposed that when light interacts with matter not only energy but also linear momentum of photon get transferred in discrete amount and both law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum hold good . the magnitude of momentum transferred with each photon of frequency f is given by p hfc h  ...  1.12 in 1923 arthur compton at washington university carried out an experiment that gave support to the view of einstein . compton arranged for a beam of xrays of wavelength to fall on a target made of graphite and measured the wavelength and intensity of xrays scattered in various direction from the target . the observed phenomenon is called a compton effect . he received nobel prize in 1927 . 12textbook of engineering physic 1.4.1definition when xrays of sharply defined frequency are incident on a material of low atomic number like carbon they suffer a change of frequency on scattering . the scattered beam contains two wavelength . in addition to the expected incident wavelength there exists a component of longer wavelength . this phenomenon is calledcompton effect . the change in wavelength from incident wavelength to scattered xray wavelength is called compton shift . explanation the classical electromagnetic theory failed to explain compton shift but compton successfully used quantum theory of radiation to explain the phenomenon . accordingly the whole process is treated a a particle collision event between xray photon and a loosely bound electron of the scatterer . in this process both momentum and energy are conserved . in this photonelectron collision a portion of the energy of the photon is transferred to the electron . a a result the xray proceeds with less than the original energy and therefore gain lower frequency or higher wavelength . 1.4.2expression for compton shift the incident photon with an energy h fand momentum h fc strike an electron at rest . the initial momentum of the electron is zero and it initial energy is only the rest mass energy m0c2 . the scattered photon of energy h f and momentum h fc move away in a direction inclined at an angle to the original direction a shown in fig . 1.7. after scattering the electron acquires a momentum mv and move at an angle to the original direction . the energy of this recoil electron is mc2 . modern physic 13 figure 1.7 scattering of photon by electron of an atom according to the principle of

eqn . 1.25 show that 1.compton shift is independent of the wavelength of incident radiation . 2.compton shift is independent of the nature of scattering substance . 3.compton shift depends only on the angle of scattering . 4.the wavelength of scattered light is always greater than the wavelength of incident light . based on angle of scattered light three case can be considered case 1 when 0 0 i.e . there is no scattering of photon along the incident direction . case 2 when 90 hm0c 0.02426 √• this is known a compton wavelength . case 3 when 180 2 hm0c 0.04852 √• this is twice of compton wavelength . 1.4.3experiment al verification of com pton shift monochromatic xrays of wavelength are allowed to fall on a scattering material like a small block of carbon . the scattered xrays are received by a bragg spectrometer and their wavelength is determined fig . 1.8. the spectrometer can freely swing in an arc about the scatterer . the wavelength of the scattered xrays is measured for different value of the scattering angle . the experimental result obtained by compton are shown in fig . 1.9. in the scattered radiation in addition to the incident wavelength modern physic 15there exists a line of longer wavelength . the compton shift is found to vary with the angle at which the scattered ray are observed . figure 1.8 schematic diag ram of compton s apparatus figure 1.9 scattered xray intensity versus wavelength of compton scattering at 0 45 90 and 135 16textbook of engineering physic 1.5wave particle du alism various optical phenomenon like reflection refraction interference diffraction and polarization of light can be easily explained by wave theory of light . but the wave theory of light failed to explain the blackbody radiation photoelectric effect and compton effect . these phenomenon can be easily explained by quantum theory of light . this show light appears in both form a to support wave theory at one hand and quantum theory on the other hand . this complex nature of light is said to be dual nature . in quantum theory of light the energy is thought to be in the form of energy packet called photon . the energy carrying particle photon itself exhibit diffraction effect thereby showing wave like character . but this lead to an important conclusion that light possesses dual character i.e . at the same time it behaves like wave and particle . 1.5.1debroglie hypothesis in 1923 louis de broglie pronounced broylee proposed that matter like radiation ha dual nature . that mean the matter which is made up of discrete particle atom proton electron etc . may exhibit wavelike property under appropriate condition . de broglie named these wave associated with material particle a matter wave . in his ph.d. thesis de broglie postulated that because photon have wave and particle characteristic perhaps all form of matter have wave a well a particle property . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1929 for unfolding the existence of wave nature of moving particle . he proposed following similarity for his hypothesis of matter wave 1.nature love symmetry the two form in which nature manifest herself are matter and radiation . we know that radiation possess dual nature so that matter also may show dual nature . physicist have rarely gone wrong by assuming the symmetry of nature . a changing magnetic field produce an electric field in nature and due to symmetry it is also found that a changing electric field produce magnetic field . 2.the close parallelism between mechanic and optic the principle of least action in mechanic state that a moving particle always chooses minimum action path . similarly the fermat principle in optic state that light always chooses a path where the time of transit is minimum . 3.bohrs theory of atomic structure according to bohr theory the stable state of electron in the atom are governed by integer rule . the only phenomenon involving integer in physic are those of interference and mode of vibration of stretched string both of which imply wave motion . hence debroglie thought that the electron may also be characterized by a periodicity like wave . the above similarity suggested that an electron or any other material particle must exhibit wave like property in addition to particlelike property . these wave associated with a material particle are called matter wave . 1.5.2debroglies wavelength the expression for de broglie matter wave can be obtained by considering einstein massenergy relationship and max planck energy equation . modern physic 17according to einstein the relationship between mass and energy of photon moving at a velocity c is given by e mc2  ...  1.26 according to max . plank the energy associated with a photon of frequency f is given by e hf hc  ...  1.27 comparing eqn . 1.26 and 1.27 mc2 hc or hmc  ...  1.28 eqn . 1.28 give the expression for the wavelength of a photon wave that move through a medium when photon travel with a velocity equal to velocity of light c. similarly when any material particle having mass m and moving with velocity v must possess a debroglie wavelength given by hmv  ...  1.29 if the material particle move with kinetic energy e ¬Ωmv2 then de broglie wavelength can be written a 2 h h mvme  ...  1.30 1.5.3 de broglie wavelength extension to electron particle consider an electron of rest mass m0 and charge e accelerated by a potential of v volt from rest to a velocityv . then we write ¬Ω m0v2 ev or 02evvm  ...  1.31 we also know that the wavelength of matter wave a hm0v  ...  1.32 using eqn . 1.31 and 1.32 we write 02h m ev  ...  1.33 putting m0 9.11 1031 kg h 6.62 1034 j and e 1.602 1019 c we get eqn . 1.33 a 12.26√• v  ...  1.34 if the accelerating voltage v 100 volt then the wavelength of electron becomes 1.226 √•. since this wavelength is comparable with the wavelength of xrays the de broglie wave should be capable of being diffracted by a crystal just like xrays . 18textbook of engineering physic 1.5.4davison and germer experiment debroglies prediction of the existence of matter wave is first verified experimentally in 1927 by c. j. davison andl.h . germer of bell telephone laboratory in new york . experimental setup figure 1.10 a schematic diagram of the davisongermer apparatu s the experimental setup is shown in fig . 1.10. electron are produced by heating a filament f by a low tension battery ltb . these electron are accelerated and focused to nickel crystal by applying accelerating voltage v. the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a movable detector . the whole experimental setup is placed inside a vacuum chamber . experimental procedure the beam of electron is allowed to fall normally on the surface of the crystal . due to normal incidence the nickel crystal act like diffraction grating and the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a detector which can be moved to position on a circular scale s and the intensity of electron beam is measured by mean of a galvanometer g. the galvanometer deflection is plotted against the angle between incident beam and the beam entering the detector . the experiment is repeated for different accelerating voltage and resulting curve are drawn . a typical curve obtained for accelerating potential of 54 v is shown in fig . 1.11. modern physic 199060max 50300 40 30 20 10 scatteredintensityarbitraryunits figure 1.11 graph of intensity of diffracted beam versus the angle between incident and diffracted beam for 54 v experimental result the graph remains fairly smooth till the accelerating voltage becomes 44 volt . at 44 volt a spur appears in the graph and a the accelerating voltage is increased the length of the spur increase till the accelerating voltage reach 54 volt at an angle of 50. with further increase in accelerating voltage the spur decrease in length and finally disappears at 68 volt . inference the occurrence of a pronounced spur at 50o with the electron accelerated through 54 volt can be explained a due to constructive interference of the electron wave scattered in this direction from the regularly spaced parallel plane in the nickel crystal . according to debroglies theory the wavelength of the electron accelerated through a potential of 54 volt is given by 12.261.66 . 54√• √• according to the experiment a diffracted beam at colatitude of 50o corresponds to the electron beam glancing angle of 65o with respect to the crystal plane is observed . for nickel the interplanar distance d is found to be 0.91 √• from the xray diffraction study . the order of diffraction is taken to be 1 in this case and applying the bragg equation n 2d sin where n refers to order of diffraction . by simplifying we get 2 0.91 √• sin 50o 1.65 √•. thus the experimental value is in close agreement with the theoretical value . this show that a beam of electron behaves like xrays suffers diffraction at reflecting surface and thus ha wavelike characteristic . 20textbook of engineering physic 1.6matter wave and their chara cteristic property unlike electromagnetic wave the matter wave have following property 1.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to mass of the particle . hence larger the mass of the particle shorter will be the wavelength and vice versa . 2.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to velocity of the particle . hence greater the velocity of the particle smaller will be the wavelength and vice versa . 3.the amplitude of the de broglie wave varies with likelihood of detecting the particle at a particular position . hence the matter wave is termed a probability wave . 4.when a particle is in motion two different velocity are associated with it . they are mechanical motion of particle vparticle and motion of associated matter wave vphase . these two are connected by a relation vphase c2vparticle . now the particle velocity vparticle c. hence the velocity of propagation of matter wave vphase c. thus matter wave can travel greater than velocity of light . 1.6.1phase velocity group velocity and p article velocity according to de broglie each particle of matter like electron proton etc . may be regarded a consisting of group of wave or a wave packet . each component wave propagates with a definite velocity called phase velocity orwave velocity . but when a disturbance consists of a number of component wave each travelling with slightly different velocity the resultant velocity will be that of a periodicity . the velocity of advance of this periodicity is called the group velocity . phase velocity the equation for a wave travelling in positive xdirection is given by sin y a t kx  ...  1.35 wherey is the displacement along ydirection at the instant t is the angular frequency k is the propagation constant and x is the displacement along xaxis at the instant t.in the above equation t kx give the phase of the vibrating particle . the phase quantity t

the word science come from a latin word scientia which mean to know . science is the knowledge gained through the systematic observation and experiment . scientific method include the systematic observation reasoning modeling and theoretical prediction . science is divided into two broad category asnatural science andphilosophical science . natural science ha many discipline physic being one of them . the word physic ha it origin in a greek word physis meaning nature . physic is the most basic science which deal with the study of nature and natural phenomenon especially property of matter energy and their interaction . understanding of science begin with understanding of physic . physic is an empirical study . everything we know about physical world and about the principle that govern it behaviour ha been learned through observation of the phenomenon of nature . the ultimate test of any physical theory is it agreement with observation and measurement of physical phenomenon . technology is the application of the doctrine in physic for practical purpose . the invention of steam engine had a great impact on human civilization . till 1933 rutherford did not believe thatobjectives this chapter contains the detailed discussion on the origin of modern physic and introduces to the subject of failure of classical mechanic and how the quantum theory consolidated the answer for the problem which were remained unanswered by classical theory . the duality of light and the hypothetical argument given by de broglie to explore the wave nature of moving particle and evidence for existence of matter wave are discussed . the main objective of this chapter are to study the failure of classical mechanic and origin of quantum mechanical theory the application of quantum idea to explain black body radiation spectrum photoelectric effect and compton effect the de broglie hypothesis matter wave and experimental evidence given by davison and germer the relation between the group velocity phase velocity particle velocity and velocity of light characteristic of matter waves1 2textbook of engineering physic energy could be tapped from atom . but in 1938 hann and meitner discovered neutroninduced fission reaction of uranium . this is the basis of nuclear weapon and nuclear reactor . the contribution of physic in the development of alternative resource of energy is significant . we are consuming the fossil fuel at such a very fast rate that there is an urgent need to discover new source of energy which are cheap . production of electricity from solar energy and geothermal energy is a reality now but we have a long way to go . another example of physic giving rise to technology is the integrated chip popularly called a ic . the development of newer ic and faster processor made the computer industry to grow leap and bound in the last three decade . computer have become affordable now due to improved production technique and low production cost . the legitimate purpose of technology is to serve people . our society is becoming more and more scienceoriented . we can contribute better to the science and society if we develop a deeper understanding of the basic law of physic . 1.2introduction t o blackbody radia tion spectr um 1.2.1introduction t o modern ph ysics at the end of nineteenth century the physic consisted of mainly newton law of motion and universal gravitation the law of conservation of energy and momentum the law of thermodynamics and maxwell equation for electricity and magnetism were all more or less nearly complete and were used to describe the machine that launched two wave of industrial revolutionthe first one powered by steam and the second one powered by electric current . most of the people believed that there is nothing new to discover in physic now . all that remains is more and more precise measurement . but lord kelvin 18241907 identified two problem with the physic at that time . they were 1 theory of luminiferous eather to explain light wave propagation in space wave theory of light and 2 the inability of electromagnetic theory of light to adequately predict the characteristic of thermal radiation . in the beginning of the 20th century the first problem wa solved by albert einstein by mean of theory of relativity . the major revelation of this theory were that there is no ether there is no absolute space there is no absolute time mass is not conserved energy is not conserved and nothing travel faster than light . for awhile this wa the most revolutionary theory in all of physic . the second problem wa solved by max karl planck 18581947 by mean of quantum mechanical theory . the major revelation of this theory are that all thing are both particle and wave at the same time and that nothing can be predicted or known with absolute certainty . the arrival of these two revolutionary theory divided physic up into two domain . all theory developed before the arrival of relativity and quantum mechanic and any work derived from them are calledclassical physic . all theory derived from the basic principle of relativity and quantum mechanic are called modern physic . the quantum mechanic principle initially could able to explain the following phenomenon successfully blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe photoelectric effect modern physic 3discrete atomic spectrum and the problem of how atom manage to exist radioactive decay 1.2.2blackbody radiation all object radiate electromagnetic energy in the form of heat continuously whatever is their temperature though which frequency predominates depends on the temperature . at room temperature most of the radiation emitted by an object is in the infrared part of the spectrum and hence the emitted radiation are invisible . ablackbody is defined a an object that absorbs all the frequency of electromagnetic radiation falling on it and consequently appears black . a blackbody or perfect absorber is also an ideal radiator which emits radiation in all frequency . such a radiation emittedradiated by a blackbody is called blackbody radiation . in practice a small opening in any heated cavity such a a port in an oven behaves like a blackbody because such an opening trap all incident radiation fig . 1.1. the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody . light entering the small opening strike the far wall where some of it is absorbed but some is reflected at a random angle . the light continues to be reflected and at each reflection a portion of the light is absorbed by the cavity wall . after many reflection essentially all of the incident energy is absorbed . if the direction of the radiation is reversed in fig . 1.1 the light emitted by a small opening is in thermal equilibrium with the wall because it ha been absorbed and reemitted many time . figure 1.1 the opening to the cavity inside a body is a good approximation of a blackbody 1.2.3blackbody radiation spectrum to study the distribution of radiant energy over different frequency the black body is maintained at a constant temperature . by mean of an infrared spectrometer and a bolometerphotodetector the emissive power of the black body for different frequency are measured . the result of the experiment is shown 4textbook of engineering physic in fig . 1.2 a blackbody radiation spectrum . in the spectrum at a given temperature the radiation intensity energy density initially increase with frequency then peak at around a particular frequency and after that decrease finally reach to zero at very high frequency . figure 1.2 blackbody radiation spectrum 1.2.4energy distribution in blackbody radiation spectrum based on the study of the blackbody radiation spectrum following observation can be made 1.the energy is not uniformly distributed with frequency . 2.at a given temperature the energy density initially increase with increase in frequency reach a maximum value and then decrease with further increase in frequency . 3.the frequency corresponding to the maximum energy density peak of the curve shift towards higher frequency side with increase in temperature . 1.2.5laws of blackbody radiation 1.stefans law in 1879 an austrian physicist josef stefan 18351893 found experimentally that the total power modern physic 5per unit area emitted at all frequency by a hot solid etotal is proportional to the fourth power of it absolute temperature . therefore stefans law may be written a 04e e df ttotal f  ...  1.1 whereetotal is the power per unit area emitted at the surface of the blackbody at all frequency efis the power per unit area per unit frequency emitted by the blackbody ti the absolute temperature of the body and is the stefanboltzmann constant given by 5.67 108 w.m2.k4 . a body that is not an ideal radiator will obey the same general law but with a coefficient which ha value less than 1 4 totale t  ...  1.2 2.weins distribution law in 1893wilhelm wien proposed a general form for the blackbody distribution law that gave the correct experimental behavior of max with temperature . this law is called wiens displacement law and may be written a 3 max2.898 10 .t mk  ...  1.3 wheremax is the wavelength in meter corresponding to the blackbody maximum intensity and ti the absolute temperature of the surface of the object emitting the radiation . assuming that the peak sensitivity of the human eye which occurs at about 500 nmbluegreen light coincides with max for the sun a blackbody we can check the consistency of wiens displacement law with stefans law by calculating the sun surface temperature t 3 92.898 10 . 500 10m k m 5800k  ...  1.4 3.weins exponential law in 1893 wein also calculated the energy per unit volume at frequency range f andf df of the radiation within the blackbody cavity uft a 3f tu f t df af e df  ...  1.5 wherea and are wiens constant . this result wa known a wiens exponential law . limitation of weins law experiment show that weins law hold good for shorter wavelength higher frequency region of the spectrum and at higher temperature of the blackbody . it fails to explain the gradual drop of the energy density at longer wavelength lower frequency after the peak value a shown in fig . 1.3 . 6textbook of engineering physic figure 1.3 discrepancy betw eenwiens law and experimental data f or a blackbody at 1500 k 4.rayleighjeans law according to lord rayleigh andjames jean the spectral energy density at frequency range f and f df is simply the density of mode multiplied by kbt or 2 38bf k tu f t df dfc  ...  1.6 wherekb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . limitation of rayleigh jean law the ultraviolet catastrophe a blackbody is an idealized object which absorbs and emits all frequency of radiation . classical physic can be used to derive an equation which describes the intensity of blackbody radiation a a function of frequency for a fixed temperaturethe result is known a the rayleighjeans law . although the rayleighjeans law work for low frequency it diverges a ∆í2 this divergence for high frequency ultraviolet frequency is called the ultraviolet catastrophe . 5.the planck radiation law in 1900max planck wa working on the problem of how the radiation an object emits is related to it temperature . he came up with a formula that agreed very closely with experimental data but the formula only made sense if he assumed that the energy of a vibrating molecule wa quantized that is it could only take on certain value . the energy would have to be proportional to the frequency of vibration and it seemed to come in little chunk of the frequency multiplied by a certain constant . this constant came to be known a planck constant orh and it ha the value h 6.626 1034 j.s . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1918. max planc k discovered the famous blackbody formula which used the quantum theory . accordingly uft is given by modern physic 73 3 8 1 1bhf k thfu f t df df c e  ...  1.7 wherehis planck constant 6.626 1034 .j.s . andkb is boltzmann constant 1.380 1023 jk . since wiens law hold good in the higher frequency region and rayleighjeans law in the lower frequency region and if plank law could able to explain the energy distribution in entire region of blackbody radiation spectrum then one should able to deduce wiens and rayleighjeans law from plank law . for higher frequency regionbhf k teis very large 1bhf k te 1b bhf hf k t k te e substitute the above approximation in 1.7 we get 3 38 bhf k thfu f t df e dfc compare the above equation with the wiens law we get38 a h c and bhk similarly for lower frequency region f is small implies bhf k t is very small and expandbhf k tea power series we have ve 2 31 11  ...  2 3bhf k t b b bhf hf hfek t k t k t since bhf k t is very small and the higher power term are very small and can be neglected 1bhf k t bhfek t substitute the above result in eqn 1.7 we get the eqn 1.6 which is the rayleighjeans law . hence the expression given by plank valid in the entire frequency region of blackbody radiation spectrum . 1.3photoelectric effect 1.3.1definition the phenomenon of emission of electron from a metal surface when illuminated by light of suitable frequency is called the photoelectric effect . photoelectric effect wa discovered by h. hertz in 1887 . 8textbook of engineering physic the photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical energy . the electron emitted during photoelectric effect are called photoelectron and the current constituted by photoelectron is called the photoelectric current . the minimum frequency of the incident radiation required for the emission of electron from the surface of a metal is called the threshold frequency of the metal . threshold frequency varies from metal to metal . it ha been observed that metal like zinc cadmium magnesium etc . show photoelectric effect only for ultraviolet light . but some alkali metal like lithium sodium potassium caesium and rubidium show photoelectric effect even for visible light . 1.3.2experimental study vaa eclight ray quartz window figure 1.4 experimental study of photoelectric effect figure 1.5 a graph of photoelectric current verse intensity of light b graph of kinetic energy of electron verse frequency of incident light modern physic 9the experimental setup consists of an evacuated glass tube which contains two electrode a cathodec and an anode a which are sealed inside the tube fig . 1.4. the tube contains a side window of quartz which allows light of reasonably short wavelength to pas through and allows to fall on cathodec . the electron emitted from cathode c will move towards the anode a. this will constitutes the photoelectron and cause photoelectric current to flow in the circuit and measured using a micro ammeter connected in the circuit . the photoelectric current can be increased or decreased by varying the magnitude and sign of the anode potential with respect to the cathode . it is observed that there is a certain minimum negative retarding potential at anode which will reduce the photoelectric current to be zero and is referred a stopping potential or retarding potential or cutoff potential represented a vs. therefore the stopping potential is defined a the minimum negative potential required at the anode so a to completely suppress the photoelectron reaching the anode and hence the current to zero in the circuit . figure 1.6 a plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at two different intensity of incident light b plot of photoelectric current versus applied potential between electrode at three different frequency of incident light experimental observation 1.photoelectric effect is an instantaneous process . photoelectron will ejected out within 109s very small time after light irradiation on the metal surface . 2.for a given photosensitive material there exist a certain minimum frequency called the cutoff or threshold frequency below which no photoelectric effect take place . 3.for a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation more than threshold frequency the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light a shown in fig . 1.5 a . 4.effect of potential at anode the graph of photoelectric current and the voltage applied between 10textbook of engineering physic the electrode cathode c and anode a show that initially the photoelectric current increase with the increasing potential . for a certain potential the current becomes maximum . for further increase in potential the graph show saturation of current horizontal portion . 5.the value of stopping potential increase with increase in frequency of the incident radiation which is shown in fig . 1.6 b . 6.the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation fig . 1.5 b. it is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation which is a shown fig . 1 . 6 a . 1.3.3laws of photoelectric effect on the basis of the above experiment lenard and millikan gave the following law regarding photoelectric effect 1.the number of photoelectron emitted per second from the metal surface is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light . 2.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron doe not depend upon the intensity of incident light . 3.the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectron increase linearly with increase in frequency of incident light . 4.if the frequency of incident light is less than certain minimum value then no photoelectron emitted from the metal surface whatever may be the intensity of incident light . this minimum frequency threshold frequency is different for different metal . 5.photoelectric process is instantaneous i.e . there is no timelag between incidence of light and emission of photoelectron . classical physic failed to explain the observed law on the basis of electromagnetic theory . 1.3.4einsteins photoelectric equation to explain the experimental observation of photoelectric effect einstein used plank quantum theory of light light beam consists of photon . he introduced a concept of work function and is nothing but the minimum energy required to make the electron to come out of the metal surface represented by . work function is measured in ev electron volt . work function depends on the property of the metal and the nature of the surface . according to einstein whenever a photon of energyhfis incident on a metal an electron absorbs it instantaneously and if the absorbed energyhf by the electron is greater than the work function binding energy of electron it will come out of the metal surface and then acquire some kinetic energy to move out with a velocityv . the energy of a photon absorbed by the electron is used in two way . ithe part of absorbed photon energy is used in releasing the electron from the metal surface iithe remaining energy appears a the kinetic energy of the electron . thus we can write energy of incident photon binding energy of electron k.e.of electron modern physic 11thenhf ¬Ω mv2 max  ...  1.8 eqn . 1.8 is the einstein photoelectric equation where is called the work function of the given metal . work function of a metal is the minimum energy needed to liberate an electron from the surface of the metal . here ¬Ω mv2 max represents the kinetic energy ke . imparted to the electron . k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf  ...  1.9 work function is different for different metal . iff0 is the threshold frequency then hf0  ...  1.10 k.e . ¬Ω mv2 maxhf hf hf0 h f f 0  ...  1.11 explanation of experimental observation using einstein photoelectric equation 1.photoelectric effect is instantaneous process because of collision between two micro particle namely an electron and a photon . 2.kinetic energy of the electron depends on the term ff 0 a seen from equation 1.11. for frequency f f 0 kinetic energy of the electron equal to zero . this frequency f 0 represents the threshold frequency . photoelectron are not emitted if f f 0 . 3.if intense light radiation is incident on a metal surface then it implies that more photon are incident on more electron and hence making more photoelectron to be emitted which increase the photoelectric current . 4.an increase in frequency of the incident radiation increase the energy of the emitted electron a given by einstein equation . the increase in frequency ha no effect on the magnitude of photo current . 5.as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron increase with frequency it requires large value of retarding potential to stop the electron . if m is the mass and e is the charge of the electron emitted with velocity v and v is the stopping potential then ev ¬Ω mv2 . thus einstein explained photoelectric effect successfully on the basis of particle nature of light and got nobel prize in 1921 . 1.4compton effect in the year 1916 einstein extended his photon concept and proposed that when light interacts with matter not only energy but also linear momentum of photon get transferred in discrete amount and both law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum hold good . the magnitude of momentum transferred with each photon of frequency f is given by p hfc h  ...  1.12 in 1923 arthur compton at washington university carried out an experiment that gave support to the view of einstein . compton arranged for a beam of xrays of wavelength to fall on a target made of graphite and measured the wavelength and intensity of xrays scattered in various direction from the target . the observed phenomenon is called a compton effect . he received nobel prize in 1927 . 12textbook of engineering physic 1.4.1definition when xrays of sharply defined frequency are incident on a material of low atomic number like carbon they suffer a change of frequency on scattering . the scattered beam contains two wavelength . in addition to the expected incident wavelength there exists a component of longer wavelength . this phenomenon is calledcompton effect . the change in wavelength from incident wavelength to scattered xray wavelength is called compton shift . explanation the classical electromagnetic theory failed to explain compton shift but compton successfully used quantum theory of radiation to explain the phenomenon . accordingly the whole process is treated a a particle collision event between xray photon and a loosely bound electron of the scatterer . in this process both momentum and energy are conserved . in this photonelectron collision a portion of the energy of the photon is transferred to the electron . a a result the xray proceeds with less than the original energy and therefore gain lower frequency or higher wavelength . 1.4.2expression for compton shift the incident photon with an energy h fand momentum h fc strike an electron at rest . the initial momentum of the electron is zero and it initial energy is only the rest mass energy m0c2 . the scattered photon of energy h f and momentum h fc move away in a direction inclined at an angle to the original direction a shown in fig . 1.7. after scattering the electron acquires a momentum mv and move at an angle to the original direction . the energy of this recoil electron is mc2 . modern physic 13 figure 1.7 scattering of photon by electron of an atom according to the principle of

eqn . 1.25 show that 1.compton shift is independent of the wavelength of incident radiation . 2.compton shift is independent of the nature of scattering substance . 3.compton shift depends only on the angle of scattering . 4.the wavelength of scattered light is always greater than the wavelength of incident light . based on angle of scattered light three case can be considered case 1 when 0 0 i.e . there is no scattering of photon along the incident direction . case 2 when 90 hm0c 0.02426 √• this is known a compton wavelength . case 3 when 180 2 hm0c 0.04852 √• this is twice of compton wavelength . 1.4.3experiment al verification of com pton shift monochromatic xrays of wavelength are allowed to fall on a scattering material like a small block of carbon . the scattered xrays are received by a bragg spectrometer and their wavelength is determined fig . 1.8. the spectrometer can freely swing in an arc about the scatterer . the wavelength of the scattered xrays is measured for different value of the scattering angle . the experimental result obtained by compton are shown in fig . 1.9. in the scattered radiation in addition to the incident wavelength modern physic 15there exists a line of longer wavelength . the compton shift is found to vary with the angle at which the scattered ray are observed . figure 1.8 schematic diag ram of compton s apparatus figure 1.9 scattered xray intensity versus wavelength of compton scattering at 0 45 90 and 135 16textbook of engineering physic 1.5wave particle du alism various optical phenomenon like reflection refraction interference diffraction and polarization of light can be easily explained by wave theory of light . but the wave theory of light failed to explain the blackbody radiation photoelectric effect and compton effect . these phenomenon can be easily explained by quantum theory of light . this show light appears in both form a to support wave theory at one hand and quantum theory on the other hand . this complex nature of light is said to be dual nature . in quantum theory of light the energy is thought to be in the form of energy packet called photon . the energy carrying particle photon itself exhibit diffraction effect thereby showing wave like character . but this lead to an important conclusion that light possesses dual character i.e . at the same time it behaves like wave and particle . 1.5.1debroglie hypothesis in 1923 louis de broglie pronounced broylee proposed that matter like radiation ha dual nature . that mean the matter which is made up of discrete particle atom proton electron etc . may exhibit wavelike property under appropriate condition . de broglie named these wave associated with material particle a matter wave . in his ph.d. thesis de broglie postulated that because photon have wave and particle characteristic perhaps all form of matter have wave a well a particle property . he ha been honoured by nobel prize in the year 1929 for unfolding the existence of wave nature of moving particle . he proposed following similarity for his hypothesis of matter wave 1.nature love symmetry the two form in which nature manifest herself are matter and radiation . we know that radiation possess dual nature so that matter also may show dual nature . physicist have rarely gone wrong by assuming the symmetry of nature . a changing magnetic field produce an electric field in nature and due to symmetry it is also found that a changing electric field produce magnetic field . 2.the close parallelism between mechanic and optic the principle of least action in mechanic state that a moving particle always chooses minimum action path . similarly the fermat principle in optic state that light always chooses a path where the time of transit is minimum . 3.bohrs theory of atomic structure according to bohr theory the stable state of electron in the atom are governed by integer rule . the only phenomenon involving integer in physic are those of interference and mode of vibration of stretched string both of which imply wave motion . hence debroglie thought that the electron may also be characterized by a periodicity like wave . the above similarity suggested that an electron or any other material particle must exhibit wave like property in addition to particlelike property . these wave associated with a material particle are called matter wave . 1.5.2debroglies wavelength the expression for de broglie matter wave can be obtained by considering einstein massenergy relationship and max planck energy equation . modern physic 17according to einstein the relationship between mass and energy of photon moving at a velocity c is given by e mc2  ...  1.26 according to max . plank the energy associated with a photon of frequency f is given by e hf hc  ...  1.27 comparing eqn . 1.26 and 1.27 mc2 hc or hmc  ...  1.28 eqn . 1.28 give the expression for the wavelength of a photon wave that move through a medium when photon travel with a velocity equal to velocity of light c. similarly when any material particle having mass m and moving with velocity v must possess a debroglie wavelength given by hmv  ...  1.29 if the material particle move with kinetic energy e ¬Ωmv2 then de broglie wavelength can be written a 2 h h mvme  ...  1.30 1.5.3 de broglie wavelength extension to electron particle consider an electron of rest mass m0 and charge e accelerated by a potential of v volt from rest to a velocityv . then we write ¬Ω m0v2 ev or 02evvm  ...  1.31 we also know that the wavelength of matter wave a hm0v  ...  1.32 using eqn . 1.31 and 1.32 we write 02h m ev  ...  1.33 putting m0 9.11 1031 kg h 6.62 1034 j and e 1.602 1019 c we get eqn . 1.33 a 12.26√• v  ...  1.34 if the accelerating voltage v 100 volt then the wavelength of electron becomes 1.226 √•. since this wavelength is comparable with the wavelength of xrays the de broglie wave should be capable of being diffracted by a crystal just like xrays . 18textbook of engineering physic 1.5.4davison and germer experiment debroglies prediction of the existence of matter wave is first verified experimentally in 1927 by c. j. davison andl.h . germer of bell telephone laboratory in new york . experimental setup figure 1.10 a schematic diagram of the davisongermer apparatu s the experimental setup is shown in fig . 1.10. electron are produced by heating a filament f by a low tension battery ltb . these electron are accelerated and focused to nickel crystal by applying accelerating voltage v. the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a movable detector . the whole experimental setup is placed inside a vacuum chamber . experimental procedure the beam of electron is allowed to fall normally on the surface of the crystal . due to normal incidence the nickel crystal act like diffraction grating and the diffracted beam is collected by mean of a detector which can be moved to position on a circular scale s and the intensity of electron beam is measured by mean of a galvanometer g. the galvanometer deflection is plotted against the angle between incident beam and the beam entering the detector . the experiment is repeated for different accelerating voltage and resulting curve are drawn . a typical curve obtained for accelerating potential of 54 v is shown in fig . 1.11. modern physic 199060max 50300 40 30 20 10 scatteredintensityarbitraryunits figure 1.11 graph of intensity of diffracted beam versus the angle between incident and diffracted beam for 54 v experimental result the graph remains fairly smooth till the accelerating voltage becomes 44 volt . at 44 volt a spur appears in the graph and a the accelerating voltage is increased the length of the spur increase till the accelerating voltage reach 54 volt at an angle of 50. with further increase in accelerating voltage the spur decrease in length and finally disappears at 68 volt . inference the occurrence of a pronounced spur at 50o with the electron accelerated through 54 volt can be explained a due to constructive interference of the electron wave scattered in this direction from the regularly spaced parallel plane in the nickel crystal . according to debroglies theory the wavelength of the electron accelerated through a potential of 54 volt is given by 12.261.66 . 54√• √• according to the experiment a diffracted beam at colatitude of 50o corresponds to the electron beam glancing angle of 65o with respect to the crystal plane is observed . for nickel the interplanar distance d is found to be 0.91 √• from the xray diffraction study . the order of diffraction is taken to be 1 in this case and applying the bragg equation n 2d sin where n refers to order of diffraction . by simplifying we get 2 0.91 √• sin 50o 1.65 √•. thus the experimental value is in close agreement with the theoretical value . this show that a beam of electron behaves like xrays suffers diffraction at reflecting surface and thus ha wavelike characteristic . 20textbook of engineering physic 1.6matter wave and their chara cteristic property unlike electromagnetic wave the matter wave have following property 1.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to mass of the particle . hence larger the mass of the particle shorter will be the wavelength and vice versa . 2.the wavelength of matter wave is inversely proportional to velocity of the particle . hence greater the velocity of the particle smaller will be the wavelength and vice versa . 3.the amplitude of the de broglie wave varies with likelihood of detecting the particle at a particular position . hence the matter wave is termed a probability wave . 4.when a particle is in motion two different velocity are associated with it . they are mechanical motion of particle vparticle and motion of associated matter wave vphase . these two are connected by a relation vphase c2vparticle . now the particle velocity vparticle c. hence the velocity of propagation of matter wave vphase c. thus matter wave can travel greater than velocity of light . 1.6.1phase velocity group velocity and p article velocity according to de broglie each particle of matter like electron proton etc . may be regarded a consisting of group of wave or a wave packet . each component wave propagates with a definite velocity called phase velocity orwave velocity . but when a disturbance consists of a number of component wave each travelling with slightly different velocity the resultant velocity will be that of a periodicity . the velocity of advance of this periodicity is called the group velocity . phase velocity the equation for a wave travelling in positive xdirection is given by sin y a t kx  ...  1.35 wherey is the displacement along ydirection at the instant t is the angular frequency k is the propagation constant and x is the displacement along xaxis at the instant t.in the above equation t kx give the phase of the vibrating particle . the phase quantity t kx is same for the particle which are in the same state of vibration same phase . therefore for those particle which are in the same phase the rate of change of t kx with respect to time is zero i.e . 0dt kxdt or 0dxkdt ordx dt k the velocity with which the phase of the vibrating particle propagates a the wave progress is called phase velocity . here the dx dt is taken a phase velocity . modern physic 21phasevk group velocity definition the velocity with which the wave packet formed due to the superposition of two or more travelling wave of slightly different frequency is transported is called group velocity . vg figure 1.12 illustration on group velocity consider two travelling wave y1 andy2 of same amplitude with slightly difference in their wavelength and are given by 1 1 1sin y a
