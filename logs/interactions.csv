Chapter 6
The Schrödinger Equation
In some cases, the slope of the potential energy may be discontinuous, e.g., V(x) may
have one form in one region of space and another form in an adjacent region. (This is
a useful mathematical approximation to real situations in which V(x) varies rapidly
over a small region of space, such as at the surface boundary of a metal.) The proce-
dure in such cases is to solve the Schrödinger equation separately in each region of
space and then require that the solutions join smoothly at the point of discontinuity.
Since the probability of finding a particle cannot vary discontinuously from point
to point, the wave function 
must be continuous.9 Since the Schrödinger equation
involves the second derivative 
the first derivative 
(which is the slope)
must also be continuous. That is, the graph of 
versus x must be smooth. (In a
special case in which the potential energy becomes infinite, this restriction is relaxed.
Since no particle can have infinite potential energy,
must be zero in regions where
V(x) is infinite. Then, at the boundary of such a region,
may be discontinuous.)
If either 
or 
were not finite or not single valued, the same would be
true of 
and 
As we will shortly see, the predictions of wave mechanics
regarding the results of measurements involve both of those quantities and would thus
not necessarily predict finite or definite values for real physical quantities. Such re-
sults would not be acceptable since measurable quantities, such as angular momentum
and position, are never infinite or multiple valued. A final restriction on the form of
the wave function 
is that in order to obey the normalization condition,
must
approach zero sufficiently fast as 
so that normalization is preserved. For fu-
ture reference, we may summarize the conditions that the wave function 
must
meet in order to be acceptable as follows:
1.
must exist and satisfy the Schrödinger equation.
2.
and 
must be continuous.
3.
and 
must be finite.
4.
and 
must be single valued.
5.
fast enough as 
so that the normalization integral, Equation
6-20, remains bounded.
Note that, given Equation 6-10, the acceptability conditions above ultimately apply
to
Questions
1. Like the classical wave equation, the Schrödinger equation is linear. Why is this
important?

EXAMPLE 6-1 A Solution to the Schrödinger Equation Show that for a free particle
of mass m moving in one dimension, the function 
is a
solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for any values of the con-
stants A and B.
SOLUTION
A free particle has no net force acting upon it, e.g., V(x)  0, in which case the
kinetic energy equals the total energy. Thus,
Differentiating
gives
and differentiating again,
Substituting into Equation 6-18,

we have
and the given 
is a solution of Equation 6-18.
6-2 The InfiniteSquare Well
A problem that provides several illustrations of the properties of wave functions and is
also one of the easiest problems to solve using the time-independent, one-dimensional
Schrödinger equation is that of the infinite square well, sometimes called the particle
in a box. A macroscopic example is a bead moving on a frictionless wire between
two massive stops clamped to the wire. We could also build such a “box” for an elec-
tron using electrodes and grids in an evacuated tube, as illustrated in Figure 6-1a.
The walls of the box are provided by the increasing potential between the grids G
and the electrode C as shown in Figures 6-1b and c. The walls can be made arbitrarily
high and steep by increasing the potential V and reducing the separation between each
grid-electrode pair. In the limit such a potential energy function looks like that in
Figure 6-2, which is a graph of the potential energy of an infinite square well. For this
problem the potential energy is of the form
6-21
Although such a potential is clearly artificial, the problem is worth careful study for
several reasons: (1) exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation can be obtained

6-1 The Schrödinger Equation in One Dimension
227
Let us solve Equation 6-15 first. The reason for doing so is twofold: (1) Equation 
6-15 does not contain the potential V(x); consequently, the time-dependent part 
of all solutions 
to the Schrödinger equation will have the same form when
the potential is not an explicit function of time, so we only have to do this once.
(2) The separation constant C has particular significance that we want to discover
before we tackle Equation 6-14. Writing Equation 6-15 as
6-16
The general solution of Equation 6-16 is
6-17a
which can also be written as
6-17b
Thus, we see that 
which describes the time variation of 
is an oscillatory
function with frequency 
However, according to the de Broglie relation
(Equation 5-1), the frequency of the wave represented by 
is 
there-
fore, we conclude that the separation constant C  E, the total energy of the particle,
and we have
6-17c
for all solutions to Equation 6-6 involving time-independent potentials. Equation 6-14
then becomes, on multiplication by 
6-18
Equation 6-18 is referred to as the time-independent Schrödinger equation.
The time-independent Schrödinger equation in one dimension is an ordinary dif-
ferential equation in one variable x and is therefore much easier to handle than the
general form of Equation 6-6. The normalization condition of Equation 6-9 can be ex-
pressed in terms of 
since the time dependence of the absolute square of the wave
function cancels. We have
6-19
and Equation 6-9 then becomes
6-20
Conditions for AcceptableWave Functions
The form of the wave function 
that satisfies Equation 6-18 depends on the form
of the potential energy function V(x). In the next few sections we will study some sim-
ple but important problems in which V(x) is specified. Our example potentials will be
approximations to real physical potentials, simplified to make calculations easier.

Relativity I
A paradox seems to arise when this situation is viewed in the rest system of the run-
ner. For him the pole, being at rest in the same inertial system, has its proper length
of 10 m. However, the runner measures the length of the barn to be
How can he possibly fit the 10-m pole into the length-contracted 2.5-m barn? The
answer is that he can’t, and the paradox vanishes, but how can that be? To understand
the answer, we need to examine two events—the coincidences of both the front and
back ends of the pole, respectively, with the rear and front doors of the barn—in the
inertial frame of the farmer and in that of the runner.
These are illustrated by the spacetime diagrams of the inertial frame S of the
farmer and barn (Figure 1-37b) and that of the runner S (Figure 1-37c). Both dia-
grams are drawn with the front end of the pole coinciding with the front door of the
barn at the instant the clocks are started. In Figure 1-37b the worldlines of the barn
doors are, of course, vertical, while those of the two ends of the pole make an angle 
 tan1
 49.1° with the x axis. Note that in S the front of the pole reaches
the rear door of the barn at ct  5 m 0.866  5.8 m simultaneous with the arrival of
the back end of the pole at the front door; i.e., at that instant in S the pole is entirely
contained in the barn.
In the runner’s rest system S it is the worldlines of the ends of the pole that are
vertical, while those of the front and rear doors of the barn make angles of 49.1° with
the x axis (since the barn moves in the x direction at v). Now we see that the rear
door passes the front of the pole at ct  2.5 m 0.866  2.9 m, but the front door of
the barn doesn’t reach the rear of the pole until ct  10 m 0.866  11.5 m. Thus, the
first of those two events occurs before the second, and the runner never sees the pole
entirely contained in the barn. Once again, the relativity of simultaneity is the key—
events simultaneous in one inertial frame are not necessarily simultaneous when
viewed from another inertial frame.
Now let’s consider a different version of this paradox, the one initially due to 
W. Rindler. Suppose the barn’s back wall were made of thick, armor-plate steel and
had no door. What do the farmer and the runner see then? Once again, in the farmer’s
(and the barn’s) rest frame, the instant the front of the pole reaches the armor plate, the
farmer shuts the door and the 10-m pole is instantaneously contained in the 5-m barn.
However, in the next instant (assuming that the pole doesn’t break) it must either bend
(i.e., rotate in spacetime) or break through the armor plate. Since this is relativity, the
runner must come to the same conclusion in his rest frame as the 2.5-m barn races to-
ward him at 
But now when the armor plate back wall contacts the front of
the pole, the barn continues to move at 
taking the front of the pole with it
and leaving at that instant 7.5 m of the pole still outside the barn. Yet like the farmer,
the runner must also see the 10-m pole entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn. How
can that be? Like this: the instant the tip of the pole hits the steel plate, that information
(an elastic shock wave) begins to propagate down the pole. Even if the wave were to
propagate at the speed of light c, it will take 
to reach the back of the pole. In the meantime, the barn door must move only 7.5 m to
reach the back of the pole and does so in only 
Thus, the runner, in agreement with the farmer, sees the 10-m pole
entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn—at least briefly!

chapter 6
the schrödinger equation
in some cases, the slope of the potential energy may be discontinuous, e.g., v(x) may
have one form in one region of space and another form in an adjacent region. (this is
a useful mathematical approximation to real situations in which v(x) varies rapidly
over a small region of space, such as at the surface boundary of a metal.) the proce-
dure in such cases is to solve the schrödinger equation separately in each region of
space and then require that the solutions join smoothly at the point of discontinuity.
since the probability of finding a particle cannot vary discontinuously from point
to point, the wave function 
must be continuous.9 since the schrödinger equation
involves the second derivative 
the first derivative 
(which is the slope)
must also be continuous. that is, the graph of 
versus x must be smooth. (in a
special case in which the potential energy becomes infinite, this restriction is relaxed.
since no particle can have infinite potential energy,
must be zero in regions where
v(x) is infinite. then, at the boundary of such a region,
may be discontinuous.)
if either 
or 
were not finite or not single valued, the same would be
true of 
and 
as we will shortly see, the predictions of wave mechanics
regarding the results of measurements involve both of those quantities and would thus
not necessarily predict finite or definite values for real physical quantities. such re-
sults would not be acceptable since measurable quantities, such as angular momentum
and position, are never infinite or multiple valued. a final restriction on the form of
the wave function 
is that in order to obey the normalization condition,
must
approach zero sufficiently fast as 
so that normalization is preserved. for fu-
ture reference, we may summarize the conditions that the wave function 
must
meet in order to be acceptable as follows:
1.
must exist and satisfy the schrödinger equation.
2.
and 
must be continuous.
3.
and 
must be finite.
4.
and 
must be single valued.
5.
fast enough as 
so that the normalization integral, equation
6-20, remains bounded.
note that, given equation 6-10, the acceptability conditions above ultimately apply
to
questions
1. like the classical wave equation, the schrödinger equation is linear. why is this
important?
2. there is no factor 
in equation 6-18. does this mean that 
must
be real?
3. why must the electric field 
be real? is it possible to find a nonreal wave
function that satisfies the classical wave equation?
4. describe how the de broglie hypothesis enters into the schrödinger wave
equation.
5. what would be the effect on the schrödinger equation of adding a constant rest
energy for a particle with mass to the total energy e in the de broglie relation

6-2 the infinitesquare well
a problem that provides several illustrations of the properties of wave functions and is
also one of the easiest problems to solve using the time-independent, one-dimensional
schrödinger equation is that of the infinite square well, sometimes called the particle
in a box. a macroscopic example is a bead moving on a frictionless wire between
two massive stops clamped to the wire. we could also build such a “box” for an elec-
tron using electrodes and grids in an evacuated tube, as illustrated in figure 6-1a.
the walls of the box are provided by the increasing potential between the grids g
and the electrode c as shown in figures 6-1b and c. the walls can be made arbitrarily
high and steep by increasing the potential v and reducing the separation between each
grid-electrode pair. in the limit such a potential energy function looks like that in
figure 6-2, which is a graph of the potential energy of an infinite square well. for this
problem the potential energy is of the form
6-21
although such a potential is clearly artificial, the problem is worth careful study for
several reasons: (1) exact solutions to the schrödinger equation can be obtained

6-1 the schrödinger equation in one dimension
227
let us solve equation 6-15 first. the reason for doing so is twofold: (1) equation 
6-15 does not contain the potential v(x); consequently, the time-dependent part 
of all solutions 
to the schrödinger equation will have the same form when
the potential is not an explicit function of time, so we only have to do this once.
(2) the separation constant c has particular significance that we want to discover
before we tackle equation 6-14. writing equation 6-15 as
6-16
the general solution of equation 6-16 is
6-17a
which can also be written as
6-17b
thus, we see that 
which describes the time variation of 
is an oscillatory
function with frequency 
however, according to the de broglie relation
(equation 5-1), the frequency of the wave represented by 
is 
there-
fore, we conclude that the separation constant c  e, the total energy of the particle,
and we have
6-17c
for all solutions to equation 6-6 involving time-independent potentials. equation 6-14
then becomes, on multiplication by 
6-18
equation 6-18 is referred to as the time-independent schrödinger equation.
the time-independent schrödinger equation in one dimension is an ordinary dif-
ferential equation in one variable x and is therefore much easier to handle than the
general form of equation 6-6. the normalization condition of equation 6-9 can be ex-
pressed in terms of 
since the time dependence of the absolute square of the wave
function cancels. we have
6-19
and equation 6-9 then becomes
6-20
conditions for acceptablewave functions
the form of the wave function 
that satisfies equation 6-18 depends on the form
of the potential energy function v(x). in the next few sections we will study some sim-
ple but important problems in which v(x) is specified. our example potentials will be
approximations to real physical potentials, simplified to make calculations easier.

4-34. suppose that, in a franck-hertz experiment, electrons of energy up to 13.0 ev can be
produced in the tube. if the tube contained atomic hydrogen, (a) what is the shortest-wavelength
spectral line that could be emitted from the tube? (b) list all of the hydrogen lines that can be
emitted by this tube.

agram covering the range from 0 ev to 60 ev for the vibrational states of this solid. what ap-
proximate energy is typical of the transitions between adjacent levels corresponding to the
larger of each pair of peaks?
4-36. the transition from the first excited state to the ground state in potassium results in the
emission of a photon with 
 770 nm if potassium vapor is used in a franck-hertz experi-
ment, at what voltage would you expect to see the first decrease in current?
4-37. if we could somehow fill a franck-hertz tube with positronium, what cathode-grid volt-
age would be needed to reach the second current decrease in the positronium equivalent of

4-38. electrons in the franck-hertz tube can also have elastic collisions with the hg atoms.
if such a collision is a head-on, what fraction of its initial kinetic energy will an electron lose,
assuming the hg atom to be at rest? if the collision is not head-on, will the fractional loss be
greater or less than this?

the lyman, balmer, paschen, and brackett series of hydrogen. show the positions of these lines
on a linear scale and indicate which ones lie in the visible.

the cathode and the grid equal to 4.0 v, i.e., not enough for the electrons to excite the hg atom’s
first excited state. therefore, the electron-hg atom collisions are elastic. (a) if the kinetic energy

relativity i
a paradox seems to arise when this situation is viewed in the rest system of the run-
ner. for him the pole, being at rest in the same inertial system, has its proper length
of 10 m. however, the runner measures the length of the barn to be
how can he possibly fit the 10-m pole into the length-contracted 2.5-m barn? the
answer is that he can’t, and the paradox vanishes, but how can that be? to understand
the answer, we need to examine two events—the coincidences of both the front and
back ends of the pole, respectively, with the rear and front doors of the barn—in the
inertial frame of the farmer and in that of the runner.
these are illustrated by the spacetime diagrams of the inertial frame s of the
farmer and barn (figure 1-37b) and that of the runner s (figure 1-37c). both dia-
grams are drawn with the front end of the pole coinciding with the front door of the
barn at the instant the clocks are started. in figure 1-37b the worldlines of the barn
doors are, of course, vertical, while those of the two ends of the pole make an angle 
 tan1
 49.1° with the x axis. note that in s the front of the pole reaches
the rear door of the barn at ct  5 m 0.866  5.8 m simultaneous with the arrival of
the back end of the pole at the front door; i.e., at that instant in s the pole is entirely
contained in the barn.
in the runner’s rest system s it is the worldlines of the ends of the pole that are
vertical, while those of the front and rear doors of the barn make angles of 49.1° with
the x axis (since the barn moves in the x direction at v). now we see that the rear
door passes the front of the pole at ct  2.5 m 0.866  2.9 m, but the front door of
the barn doesn’t reach the rear of the pole until ct  10 m 0.866  11.5 m. thus, the
first of those two events occurs before the second, and the runner never sees the pole
entirely contained in the barn. once again, the relativity of simultaneity is the key—
events simultaneous in one inertial frame are not necessarily simultaneous when
viewed from another inertial frame.
now let’s consider a different version of this paradox, the one initially due to 
w. rindler. suppose the barn’s back wall were made of thick, armor-plate steel and
had no door. what do the farmer and the runner see then? once again, in the farmer’s
(and the barn’s) rest frame, the instant the front of the pole reaches the armor plate, the
farmer shuts the door and the 10-m pole is instantaneously contained in the 5-m barn.
however, in the next instant (assuming that the pole doesn’t break) it must either bend
(i.e., rotate in spacetime) or break through the armor plate. since this is relativity, the
runner must come to the same conclusion in his rest frame as the 2.5-m barn races to-
ward him at 
but now when the armor plate back wall contacts the front of
the pole, the barn continues to move at 
taking the front of the pole with it
and leaving at that instant 7.5 m of the pole still outside the barn. yet like the farmer,
the runner must also see the 10-m pole entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn. how
can that be? like this: the instant the tip of the pole hits the steel plate, that information
(an elastic shock wave) begins to propagate down the pole. even if the wave were to
propagate at the speed of light c, it will take 
to reach the back of the pole. in the meantime, the barn door must move only 7.5 m to
reach the back of the pole and does so in only 
thus, the runner, in agreement with the farmer, sees the 10-m pole
entirely contained within the 2.5-m barn—at least briefly!

quantization of charge, light, and energy
arthur compton. after
discovering the compton
effect, he became a world
traveler seeking an
explanation for cosmic rays.
he ultimately showed that
their intensity varied with
latitude, indicating an
interaction with earth’s
magnetic field, and thus
proved that they are charged
particles. [courtesy of

each scattering angle corresponds to scattering with no shift in the wavelength due
to scattering by the inner electrons of carbon. since these are tightly bound to the
atom, it is the entire atom that recoils rather than the individual electrons. the ex-
pected shift in this case is given by equation 3-25, with 
being the mass of the atom,
which is about 
times that of the electron; thus, this shift is negligible. the varia-
tion of 
with 
was found to be that predicted by equation 3-25.
we have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with matter is a discrete interaction that occurs at the
atomic level. it is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

chapter 4
the nuclear atom
4-5 the franck-hertz experiment
we conclude this chapter with discussion of an important experiment that provi-
ded strong support for the quantization of atomic energies, thus helping to pave the
way for modern quantum mechanics. while investigating the inelastic scattering of
electrons, j. franck and g. hertz20 made a discovery that confirmed by direct
measurement bohr’s hypothesis of energy quantization in atoms. first done in 1914,
it is now a standard undergraduate laboratory experiment. figure 4-22a is a schematic
diagram of the apparatus. a small heater heats the cathode. electrons are ejected from
the heated cathode and accelerated toward a grid, which is at a positive potential v0
relative to the cathode. some electrons pass through the grid and reach the plate p,
which is at a slightly lower potential vp  v0  v. the tube is filled with a 
low-pressure gas of the element being investigated (mercury vapor, in franck and
hertz’s experiment). the experiment involves measuring the plate current as a func-
tion of v0. as v0 is increased from 0, the current increases until a critical value (about
4.9 v for hg) is reached, at which point the current suddenly decreases. as v0 is in-
creased further, the current rises again.
the explanation of this result is a bit easier to visualize if we think for the mo-
ment of a tube filled with hydrogen atoms instead of mercury. (see figure 4-22b.)
electrons accelerated by v0 that collide with hydrogen electrons cannot transfer en-
ergy to the latter unless they have acquired kinetic energy ev0  e2  e1  10.2 ev
since the hydrogen electron according to bohr’s model cannot occupy states with en-
ergies intermediate between e1 and e2. such a collision will thus be elastic; i.e., the
incident electron’s kinetic energy will be unchanged by the collision, and thus it can
overcome the potential v and contribute to the current i. however, if ev0

figure 4-22 (a) schematic diagram of the franck-hertz experiment. electrons ejected from the heated cathode c at zero
potential are drawn to the positive grid g. those passing through the holes in the grid can reach the plate p and thereby
contribute to the current i if they have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the small back potential v. the tube contains a
low-pressure gas of the element being studied. (b) results for hydrogen. if the incoming electron does not have sufficient
energy to transfer e  e2  e1 to the hydrogen electron in the n  1 orbit (ground state), then the scattering will be elastic.
if the incoming electron does have at least e kinetic energy, then an inelastic collision can occur in which e is transferred to
the n  1 electron, moving it to the n  2 orbit. the excited electron will typically return to the ground state very quickly,
emitting a photon of energy e. 4-5 the franck-hertz experiment
175
then the incoming electron can transfer 10.2 ev to the hydrogen electron in the ground
state (n  1 orbit), putting it into the n  2 orbit (called the first excited state). the
incoming electron’s energy is thus reduced by 10.2 ev; it has been inelastically scat-
tered. with insufficient energy to overcome the small retarding potential v, the in-
coming electrons can no longer contribute to the plate current i, and i drops sharply.
the situation with hg in the tube is more complicated since hg has 80 electrons.
although bohr’s theory cannot predict their individual energies, we still expect the en-
ergy to be quantized with a ground state, first excited state, and so on, for the atom.
thus, the explanation of the observed 4.9-v critical potential for hg is that the first
excited state is about 4.9 ev above the lowest level (ground state). electrons with en-
ergy less than this cannot lose energy to the hg atoms, but electrons with energy
greater than 4.9 ev can have inelastic collisions and lose 4.9 ev. if this happens near
the grid, these electrons cannot gain enough energy to overcome the small back volt-
age v and reach the plate; the current therefore decreases. if this explanation is cor-
rect, the hg atoms that are excited to an energy level of 4.9 ev above the ground state
should return to the ground state by emitting light of wavelength
there is indeed a line of this wavelength in the mercury spectrum. when the tube is
viewed with a spectroscope, this line is seen when v0 is greater than 4.9 ev, while no
lines are seen when v0 is less than this amount. for further increases in v0, additional
sharp decreases in the current are observed, corresponding either to excitation of other
levels in hg (e.g., the second excited state of hg is at 6.7 ev above the ground state)
or to multiple excitations of the first excited state, i.e., due to an electron losing 4.9
ev more than once. in the usual setup, multiple excitations of the first level are
observed and dips are seen every 4.9 v.21 the probability of observing such multiple
first-level excitations, or excitations of other levels, depends on the detailed variation
of the potential of the tube. for example, a second decrease in the current at
v0  2  4.9  9.8 v results when electrons have inelastic collisions with hg atoms
about halfway between the cathode and grid (see figure 4-22a). they are reacceler-
ated, reaching 4.9 ev again in the vicinity of the grid. a plot of the data of franck and
hertz is shown in figure 4-23.
the franck-hertz experiment was an important confirmation of the idea that dis-
crete optical spectra were due to the existence in atoms of discrete energy levels that
could be excited by nonoptical methods. it is particularly gratifying to be able to de-
tect the existence of discrete energy levels directly by measurements using only volt-
meters and ammeters.
electron energy loss spectroscopy
the franck-hertz experiment was the precursor of a highly sensitive technique for
measuring the quantized energy states of atoms in both gases and solids. the tech-
nique, called electron energy loss spectroscopy (eels), is particularly useful in
solids, where it makes possible measurement of the energy of certain types of lattice
vibrations and other processes. it works like this. suppose that the electrons in an in-
cident beam all have energy einc. they collide with the atoms of a material, causing
them to undergo some process (e.g., vibration, lattice rearrangement, electron excita-
tion) that requires energy el. then, if a beam electron initiates a single such process,
it will exit the material with energy einc  el —i.e., it has been inelastically scattered.

auger electrons
the process of producing x rays necessarily results in the ionization of the atom since
an inner electron is ejected. the vacancy created is filled by an outer electron, pro-
ducing the x rays studied by moseley. in 1923 pierre auger discovered that, as an
alternative to x-ray emission, the atom may eject a third electron from a higher-energy
outer shell via a radiationless process called the auger effect. in the auger (pro-
nounced oh-zhay) process, the energy difference e  e2  e1 that could have
resulted in the emission of a 
x ray is removed from the atom by the third electron,
e.g., one in the n  3 shell. since the magnitude of e3  e, the n  3 electron would
leave the atom with a characteristic kinetic energy 
which is determined by
the stationary-state energies of the particular atom.19 thus, each element has a char-
acteristic auger electron spectrum. (see figure 4-21a.) measurement of the auger
electrons provides a simple and highly sensitive tool for identifying impurities on
clean surfaces in electron microscope systems and investigating electron energy shifts
associated with molecular bonding. (see figure 4-21b.)

explanation for cosmic rays.

each scattering angle corresponds to scattering with no shift in the wavelength due
to scattering by the inner electrons of carbon. since these are tightly bound to the
atom, it is the entire atom that recoils rather than the individual electrons. the ex-
pected shift in this case is given by equation 3-25, with 
being the mass of the atom,
which is about 
times that of the electron; thus, this shift is negligible. the varia-
tion of 
with 
was found to be that predicted by equation 3-25.
we have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with matter is a discrete interaction that occurs at the
atomic level. it is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

and discussed at some length the three primary ways by which photons interact with
matter: (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) the compton effect, and (3) pair production.
as we proceed with our explorations of modern physics throughout the remainder of
the book, we will have many occasions to apply what we have learned here to aid in
our understanding of myriad phenomena, ranging from atomic structure to the fusion
“furnaces” of stars.

he idea that all matter is composed of tiny particles, or atoms, dates to the specu-
lations of the greek philosopher democritus1 and his teacher leucippus in about
450 b.c. however, little attempt was made to correlate such speculations with obser-
vations of the physical world until the seventeenth century. pierre gassendi, in the
mid-seventeenth century, and robert hooke, somewhat later, attempted to explain
states of matter and the transitions between them with a model of tiny, indestructible
solid objects flying in all directions. but it was avogadro’s hypothesis, advanced in
1811, that all gases at a given temperature contain the same number of molecules per
unit volume, that led to great success in the interpretation of chemical reactions and
to development of kinetic theory in about 1900. avogadro’s hypothesis made possible
quantitative understanding of many bulk properties of matter and led to general
(though not unanimous) acceptance of the molecular theory of matter. thus, matter is
not continuous, as it appears, but is quantized (i.e., discrete) on the microscopic scale.
scientists of the day understood that the small size of the atom prevented the dis-
creteness of matter from being readily observable.
in this chapter, we will study how three additional great quantization discoveries
were made: (1) electric charge, (2) light energy, and (3) energy of oscillating me-
chanical systems. the quantization of electric charge was not particularly surprising
to scientists in 1900; it was quite analogous to the quantization of mass. however, the
quantization of light energy and mechanical energy, which are of central importance
in modern physics, were revolutionary ideas.

compton effect
it had been observed that scattered x rays were “softer” than those in the incident
beam, that is, were absorbed more readily. compton16 pointed out that if the scatter-
ing process were considered a “collision” between a photon of energy 
(and mo-
mentum 
) and an electron, the recoiling electron would absorb part of the inci-
dent photon’s energy. the energy 
of the scattered photon would therefore be less
than the incident one and thus of lower frequency 
and momentum 
(the fact
that electromagnetic radiation of energy 
carried momentum 
was known from
classical theory and from the experiments of nichols and hull in 1903. this relation
is also consistent with the relativistic expression 
for a particle
with zero rest energy.) compton applied the laws of conservation of momentum and
energy in their relativistic form (see chapter 2) to the collision of a photon with an
isolated electron to obtain the change in the wavelength 
of the photon as a
function of the scattering angle 
the result, called compton’s equation and derived
in a more section on the home page, is
3-25
the change in wavelength is thus predicted to be independent of the original wave-
length. the quantity 
has the dimensions of length and is called the compton
wavelength of the electron. its value is
because 
is small, it is difficult to observe unless 
is very small so that the
fractional change 
is appreciable. for this reason the compton effect is
generally only observed for x rays and gamma radiation.
compton verified his result experimentally using the characteristic x-ray line of
wavelength 0.0711 nm from molybdenum for the incident monochromatic photons
and scattering these photons from electrons in graphite. the wavelength of the scat-
tered photons was measured using a bragg crystal spectrometer. his experimental
arrangement is shown in figure 3-16; figure 3-17 shows his results. the first peak at

quantization of charge, light, and energy
arthur compton. after
discovering the compton
effect, he became a world
traveler seeking an
explanation for cosmic rays.
he ultimately showed that
their intensity varied with
latitude, indicating an
interaction with earth’s
magnetic field, and thus
proved that they are charged
particles. [courtesy of
american institute of physics,
niels bohr library.]
each scattering angle corresponds to scattering with no shift in the wavelength due
to scattering by the inner electrons of carbon. since these are tightly bound to the
atom, it is the entire atom that recoils rather than the individual electrons. the ex-
pected shift in this case is given by equation 3-25, with 
being the mass of the atom,
which is about 
times that of the electron; thus, this shift is negligible. the varia-
tion of 
with 
was found to be that predicted by equation 3-25.
we have seen in this section and the preceding two sections that the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with matter is a discrete interaction that occurs at the
atomic level. it is perhaps curious that after so many years of debate about the nature
of light, we now find that we must have both a particle (i.e., quantum) theory to de-
scribe in detail the energy exchange between electromagnetic radiation and matter and
a wave theory to describe the interference and diffraction of electromagnetic radiation.
we will discuss this so-called wave-particle duality in more detail in chapter 5.

questions
5. why is it extremely difficult to observe the compton effect using visible light?
6. why is the compton effect unimportant in the transmission of television and
radio waves? how many compton scatterings would a typical fm signal have
before its wavelengths were shifted by 0.01 percent?

A Final Comment
In this chapter, together with Section 2-4 of the previous chapter, we have introduced
and discussed at some length the three primary ways by which photons interact with
matter: (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) the Compton effect, and (3) pair production.
As we proceed with our explorations of modern physics throughout the remainder of
the book, we will have many occasions to apply what we have learned here to aid in
our understanding of myriad phenomena, ranging from atomic structure to the fusion
“furnaces” of stars.

Compton Effect
It had been observed that scattered x rays were “softer” than those in the incident
beam, that is, were absorbed more readily. Compton16 pointed out that if the scatter-
ing process were considered a “collision” between a photon of energy 
(and mo-
mentum 
) and an electron, the recoiling electron would absorb part of the inci-
dent photon’s energy. The energy 
of the scattered photon would therefore be less
than the incident one and thus of lower frequency 
and momentum 
(The fact
that electromagnetic radiation of energy 
carried momentum 
was known from
classical theory and from the experiments of Nichols and Hull in 1903. This relation
is also consistent with the relativistic expression 
for a particle
with zero rest energy.) Compton applied the laws of conservation of momentum and
energy in their relativistic form (see Chapter 2) to the collision of a photon with an
isolated electron to obtain the change in the wavelength 
of the photon as a
function of the scattering angle 
The result, called Compton’s equation and derived
in a More section on the home page, is
3-25
The change in wavelength is thus predicted to be independent of the original wave-
length. The quantity 
has the dimensions of length and is called the Compton
wavelength of the electron. Its value is
Because 
is small, it is difficult to observe unless 
is very small so that the
fractional change 
is appreciable. For this reason the Compton effect is
generally only observed for x rays and gamma radiation.
Compton verified his result experimentally using the characteristic x-ray line of
wavelength 0.0711 nm from molybdenum for the incident monochromatic photons
and scattering these photons from electrons in graphite. The wavelength of the scat-
tered photons was measured using a Bragg crystal spectrometer. His experimental
arrangement is shown in Figure 3-16; Figure 3-17 shows his results. The first peak at

A Final Comment
In this chapter, together with Section 2-4 of the previous chapter, we have introduced
and discussed at some length the three primary ways by which photons interact with
matter: (1) the photoelectric effect, (2) the Compton effect, and (3) pair production.
As we proceed with our explorations of modern physics throughout the remainder of
the book, we will have many occasions to apply what we have learned here to aid in
our understanding of myriad phenomena, ranging from atomic structure to the fusion
“furnaces” of stars.
