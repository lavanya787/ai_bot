| `app.py`                 | Entry point to run the bot system (UI or CLI). |
| `config/`                | YAML configuration files for training, model, and retrieval. |
| `chat/`                  | Chat interface logic including chat engine and storage. |
| `core/`                  | Core processing logic like file handling and routing. |
| `data/`                  | Stores uploaded raw files and processed text data. |
| `embedding_store/`       | Stores vector embeddings, chunk metadata, and related info. |
| `evaluation/`            | Scripts and data for model evaluation and benchmarking. |
| `file_processing/`       | File parsing, chunking, OCR, and preprocessing pipeline. |
| `intent/`                | Intent classification logic and models. |
| `llm_components/`        | Transformer or BPE-based tokenizer and RAG model classes. |
| `logs/`                  | Training and runtime logs. |
| `memory/`                | Memory module for chat continuity or long-term context. |
| `models/`                | Custom LSTM, Transformer, QA models, and training scripts. |
| `notebooks/`             | Jupyter notebooks for experiments and evaluations. |
| `rag_data/`              | (Optional) Datasets specifically for RAG or pretraining. |
| `reports/`               | Generates visual PDF/HTML reports on results. |
| `retriever/`             | Retrieval logic using BM25, TF-IDF, hybrid or FAISS. |
| `saved_models/`          | Checkpoints and trained models. |
| `scripts/`               | CLI training, inference, domain routing scripts. |
| `tokenizer/`             | Custom tokenizer and vocab generator code. |
| `training_data/`         | Labeled training data like QA pairs and corpora. |
| `utils/`                 | Helper utilities: file upload, logging, query parsing, etc. |
| `vector_db/`             | FAISS or vector DB management logic. |
