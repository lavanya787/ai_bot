GunionWhat is Modern Physics?\nThe study of Modern Physics is the study of the enormous revolution in our\nview of the physical universe that began just prior to 1900.\nAt that time, most physicists believed that everything in physics was\ncompletely understood. Normal intuition and all experiments \ufb01t into the\ncontext of two basic theories:\n1.Newtonian Mechanics for massive bodies;\n2.Maxwell\u2019s Theory for light (electromagnetic radiation).\nConsistency of the two required that there be a propagating medium (and,\ntherefore, a preferred reference frame) for light.\nHowever, even a little thought made it clear that there was trouble on\nthe horizon. And then came many new experimental results that made it\nclear that the then-existing theoretical framework was woefully inadequate\nto describe nature.\nIn a relatively short period of time, physicists were compelled to adopt:\nJ.
